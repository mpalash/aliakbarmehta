  I create immersive cyber archives that map narratives of history, memory, and
  identity through a multifocal lens of violence, conflict, and trauma. Such
  archival mappings – as drawings, paintings, new media works, net-based
  projects, poems, essays, and theoretical texts, as well as performances both
  of bodies and networks – are rooted in datafeminist, posthumanist critical
  theories of making visible hegemonic power relations and silenced historical
  materialism.


  In my current capacity as a Doctoral Candidate at Aalto University, my research *titled ‘Practicing Online Performativity: Constructing Politically Conscious Archives for the Future’* investigates (infra)structural and performative relations between online archives and its users by exploring how visual cultures and the art field interact with other fields and systemic conditions such as globalisation, consent-based democratic frameworks, financialisation, socio-political regimes, and histories of material & systemic repression.
