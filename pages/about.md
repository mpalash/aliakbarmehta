summary: "I create immersive cyber archives that map narratives of history,
  memory, and identity through a multifocal lens of violence, conflict, and
  trauma. Such archival mappings – as drawings, paintings, new media works,
  net-based projects, poems, essays, and theoretical texts, as well as
  performances both of bodies and networks – are rooted in datafeminist,
  posthumanist critical theories of making visible hegemonic power relations and
  silenced historical materialism. My ongoing doctoral research _‘Practicing
  Online Performativity: Constructing Politically Conscious Archives for the
  Future’_, is interested in exploring the performative relations between online
  archives and its users through mediated interventions of Second Order
  Cybernetics, to create speculative knowledge systems that outline new
  political public spheres."
