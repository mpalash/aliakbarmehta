summary: >-
  I find myself excited by Ali Akbar Mehta’s engagement with a world of rapidly,
  even exponentially escalating technological, social and ecological
  transformation – a world that has thrown up a series of ethical, aesthetic and
  political challenges, while also obliging us to alter, sometimes radically,
  our received definitions of individual subjectivity and ambient context (the
  network and meshwork relationalities blur the lines between these formerly
  distinct entities), nature and artifice (digital, virtual, augmented and
  hybrid environments possess a compelling psychic and effectively material
  reality, especially to a digital native, that cannot simply be dismissed as
  unreal), body and world (nano-technologies, surveillance devices,
  communication tools have changed our sense of where one ends and the other
  begins), and so forth.


  In such a world, Mehta invites us to consider the nature of the archive as a resource and point of departure for art-making as well as ethical and political action; the residual questions of hegemony and colonialism that accompany it (who builds an archive; who has access to it; who controls the annotation that accompanies the records?), and organises an inquiry into how we may conceive of the archive in its expanded, rhizomatic and hyper-connected avatars in cyberspace as a ‘cyber archive’.

In a key move, Mehta invokes the trope of philology, advancing the claim that, as we go deeper into an epoch when our lifeworlds will be highly encrypted, the cyber archive will function as a language – I find myself thinking, here, of Wittgenstein’s cryptic suggestion that a language is a form of life – by means of which to negotiate and decode such a lifeworld. As a cultural theorist and curator, I find myself enthralled by this thesis, its explorations and its implications for the human subject and artistic agency in an epoch marked by a dramatic form of inter-species mutation as we all become cyborgs, organisms constituted as much by human consciousness as by technological prostheses.

Thus, it seems to me that Mehta’s choice of topic and his articulation of his artistic and scientific goals, in this thesis, closely reflect his preoccupations and anxieties as an imaginative, art-making subject and as the citizen-navigator of a complex present (in his chosen phraseology, a ‘User’ of the mercurial cyber archive). Significantly, also, he does not simply surrender before the already vast and ever-increasing bibliography on the subject of the archive; rather, he defines his area of study in relation to the particularities of the artistic and theoretical ground he has mapped as relevant to himself and his location, which straddles an organic belonging in the global South and an equally strong connection in the global North.

Thus, as he explores the cyber archive as a location for the production of culture he cites, as his points of inspiration, thinkers who have committed themselves to mapping grounds of transformation: the Agamben of The Experiential Field, charting the connection between poetry and philosophy; the nuancing of habitus, and the relationship between locus, power, disposition and experience by Pierre Bourdieu in The Cultural Field; and the transcultural potentialities of The Nth Field as theorised by Nancy Adajania.

Not only does Mehta demonstrate a command of the sources, materials and debates around his subject, but he also amplifies the horizon of reference to include thinkers and artists based in, or speaking from, the global South – thus refreshing the now considerable archive, if you will, of academic and artistic treatments of the archive. His approach is encyclopaedic – and his inquiry, compelling as it is, takes on the daunting challenge of bringing together a variety of themes (including, for instance, the archive, the commons, the politics of togetherness, translation as a mode of overcoming mutual atomisation and alienation, the emancipatory hope of pedagogy in a “knowledge society without knowledge” or with fragmented knowledges, and the formation of communities that perform and re-tool knowledge, as platforms of resistance to the large-scale flattening of experience and expression) while also crafting conceptual tools on the go, as it were, offering analysis, manifesto, and lexicon in succession.

At some point in this endeavour, the thesis unfolds as a constellation – and I begin to wonder whether it might not have assumed the form of an exhibition, or a performance, or a cyber-concert, or a hybrid conference. And then I stop myself and think that, perhaps, this is the intent of Mehta’s thesis – to compress an expansive and existentially urgent inquiry into the format of an academic investigation, while simultaneously pushing up against and beyond the constraints of such a format. The doing of this thesis emerges as an artistic strategy; and yet, it carried forward the impulse of scientific curiosity and a will-to-systematisation.
