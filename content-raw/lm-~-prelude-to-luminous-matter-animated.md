Prelude to the animated short film 'Luminous Matter', which is set in a
parallel post-apocalyptic present, where mankind no longer exists.

In a world covered with nuclear fog and left to total ruin, a rapidly evolving race of uranium-based life forms called Ouraosteus have emerged. This stop motion animated short follows the story of the last survivor of the endangered species called Ouraosteus Lutessentia who is being hunted down by a superior predatorily race of Ouraosteus Ablissentia. The last Lutessentia has stumbled upon the "house of the forgotten" and the key to its survival and evolution.
