summary: >-
  The Archive as Contemporary Object ‘X’ (ArCo-X) is a podcast series project
  that investigates through discourse, the nature of the archival today, seeking
  to unpack the several system issues affecting the world around us, through a
  multifocal lens of archiving as artistic, curatorial, and research praxis. In
  these critical discussions, the invited speakers – critical thinkers, media
  theorists, data law and policymakers, social activists, political theorists,
  art and cultural workers, as well as the moderator/hosts – will examine how
  data censorship, power/knowledge matrix, and direct, structural, and cultural
  forms of violence affect the way we interface with data and shape our online
  archives. The project is crucial in consolidating the active and present
  voices to reveal how ‘queer anti-racist post-internet aesthetics’ may be
  utilised to create ‘Politically Conscious Archives’ for the future: as
  open-source, free, online platforms.


  The first six episodes will be broadcasted as part of online programming for **Party Office** during documenta(15)
