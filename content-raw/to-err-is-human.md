The Mänttä Art Festival’s artist list and theme for 2020 have been published. This year’s exhibition title is **Erehtyminen / To Err Is Human**. 

"When looking for humanity, I kept running up against errors. Mistakes that keep us from being humane and others that launch us unexpectedly closer. Today, with the ever-growing presence of artificial intelligence, our ability to make mistakes is an increasingly significant aspect of our humanity", curator Anna Ruth explains about the theme.
