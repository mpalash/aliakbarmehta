summary: >-
  I’m a co-founder of the **[Museum of Impossible
  Forms](https://museumofimpossibleforms.org/)** – an anti-racist, queer
  feminist cultural centre – located in Kontula, Helsinki.In 2018, I was
  appointed its co-Artistic Director along with Marianne Savallampi, for a
  period of two years, from 2019-2020.


  Together, we have been a team "responsible for managing M{if}’s multilingual library and its ongoing archive, as well as the overall programming – including curating workshops and events, making coffee, maintaining the space and its day-to-day functioning, liaising with invited artists and performers, offering technical and documentation support, as well as managing finances and accounts”.


  In short, the co-Artistic Directorship is a position of work that cuts through multiple strata of infrastructural praxis, and as such, is a consolidated set of roles that normally (within an institutional setting) would be distributed through a hierarchical framework. Through multi-layered, recurrent work, we have aimed to create a space and ethos that facilitates the conditions for making significant interventions through cinema, performance, music, spoken word, visual arts, and activism based practices, discourses, and pedagogies.

> In the Autumn of 2016, a group of 7 artists, curators, philosophers, theorists and cultural workers attempted to respond to the gaping void of Independent and artist-run spaces within Helsinki. This collective, the **[Museum of Impossible Forms](https://museumofimpossibleforms.org/)** applied for a grant from Kone Foundation for funding to conceive, launch and run a space in Kontula, Helsinki. A decision to house ourselves in a space previously occupied by a Night School, allowed us to evolve from a space of exhibition to a space focusing on 'Alternate Pedagogy', and respond to the unmet needs of the City, where a space of and gathering of the subaltern may take place, without the toxic presence of prejudice and the overbearing sense of anxiety.

> **[Museum of Impossible Forms](https://museumofimpossibleforms.org/)**, dubbed M{*if*} by those who know it, is a cultural centre located in Kontula, East-Helsinki. For us the Museum is a space in flux – a contested space representing a contact zone, a space of unlearning, formulating identity constructs, norm-critical consciousness and critical thinking, already containing within it the potential for the *para museum*, the *counter museum*, the *anti museum*. ‘Impossible Forms’ are those that facilitate the process of transgressing the boundaries/borders between art, politics, practice, theory, the artist and the spectator.

> Museum of Impossible Forms was founded by an independent group of Helsinki artists/ curators/ philosophers/ activists/ pedagogists in spring 2017 as an antiracist and queer-feminist project, a heterogeneous space, and as an experimental and migrant form of expression. The Museum of Impossible Forms opens up a broad horizon through its political character, its accessibility and openness, its multilingual ***[library](https://museumofimpossibleforms.org/library)***, an ongoing ***[archive](https://museumofimpossibleforms.org/archives)***, and through its ***[workshops and events](https://museumofimpossibleforms.org/events)***.
