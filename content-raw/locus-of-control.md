summary: >-
  **LOCUS OF CONTROL** is a psychological concept that refers to how strongly
  people believe they have control over the situations and experiences that
  affect their lives. The concept was developed by Julian B. Rotter in 1954 and
  has since become an aspect of personality psychology. A person's "locus"
  (plural "loci", Latin for "place" or "location") is conceptualized as internal
  (a belief that one can control one's own life) or external (a belief that life
  is controlled by outside factors which the person cannot influence, or that
  chance or fate controls their lives). In a pandemic where many of us were
  challenged to find solutions, to face extreme difficulties, and anxieties,
  some were able to collectively get through such a difficult period in human
  history through creative expressions, while some continue to suffer and learn
  the ways of healing. In this exhibition, we explore this idea, the resilience
  of humankind, our hopes, frustrations, and making sense of the world while it
  is still testing positive for Covid."
