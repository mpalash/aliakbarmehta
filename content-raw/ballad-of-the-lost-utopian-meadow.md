['Ballad of the Lost Utopian Meadow'](https://www.thelostutopianmeadow.com/) is an archive of Finnish food. The project extends the metaphorical implications of what a meadow means to Finland within the contexts of ecological conservation, cultural significance, and as a site of contemporary co-existence.

Conceived by Ali Akbar Mehta and Vidha Saumya for ONOMA summer exhibitions 2020 ‘Meadow’, curated by Taru Elfving, the 71 stanzas of the ballad have been transformed into a sound piece with vocals and piano by the amazing #varialambo (Varia Sjöström and Hatz Lambo), sound design by Kim Modig (orker), and recorded at the beautiful studios of Artlab Studio by Albert Ihanus.

The project was produced with the support of **[Contemporary Art Archipelago (CAA)](https://contemporaryartarchipelago.org/commission/ballad-of-the-lost-utopian-meadow-a-finnish-food-archive-by-vidha-saumya-ali-akbar-mehta/)** as part of the *Spectres in Change* project, funded by **Kone Foundation**.
