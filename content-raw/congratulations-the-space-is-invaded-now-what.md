“Congratulations, the Space is invaded: Now What?”, at SPACE INVADERS VI -
'Living Together’, Helsinki, 2018

By looking at the repeated gestures of Space Invasion and subsequent
post-revolution spaces, we understand that the main difficulty in
post-revolution spaces is maintaining the changed status quo, and to not
revert back into sedimented hegemonies of power.

If Invading Space as an artistic practice may be thought to resonate with
anarchist thinking, ie. a reclaiming of space from sedimented and stratified
practices of capital based allocations of space, then we have to ask or think
together, 'How, may archives help us to not have to start from zero, when
Invading Spaces? What to do after Invading Space? How can we take space to
make space?'
