Narrating WAR / HABITAT 1, performance-Installation by Ali Akbar Mehta and varialambo, 2021

<br/>

The exhibition discusses power relations, practices, and systems that define groups of people or individuals according to how well they fit into the norms in power. Who are we dependent on? Who has the power to decide the things that affect us and how do those decisions affect our lives? What is the norm? The exhibition is based on the current period of exception, which has raised these issues even more strongly.
