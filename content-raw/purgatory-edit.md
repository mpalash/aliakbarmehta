summary: >-
  Purgatory EDIT is a user-generated montage-based cinematic experience. Based
  on the principles of the Yugoslavian ‘Black Wave Cinema’ movement, “standing
  for the subordination of form to the psychological contents of human ethical
  and metaphysical drama today”; and on Artaud’s ‘Theatre of Cruelty’ as “a
  means by which artists assault the senses of the audience”, it highlights the
  methods through which digital technologies affect subliminal visual
  manipulation, sensory overload, data fatigue, psychological reaction, and
  ideological numbness.


  Purgatory EDIT, as an interactive audiovisual performance installation, is inspired by the Ludovico Technique, a fictional negative-aversion technique depicted in ‘A Clockwork Orange’ (1971) directed by Stanley Kubrick, based on Anthony Burgess’s novel: 


  > In the film, Dr Brodsky (Carl Duering) of the Ludovico medical facility forces Alex (Malcolm McDowell) to watch violent images for extended periods of time as his eyes are held open with specula, while being pumped with nausea-, paralysis- and fear-inducing drugs at the same time. Its objective: the development of a nauseous association when experiencing or thinking about violence, causing an aversion.

  As a speculative installation, Purgatory EDIT mimics the Ludovico Technique (although without pumping participants with nausea-, paralysis- and fear-inducing drugs) that parallels the dystopian narrative of A Clockwork Orange, to scrutinise the boundaries between aversion and enforcement, proclivity and phobia. It explores the value of worldviews concocted through prosaic binaries such as ‘Good and Evil’, or ‘War and Peace’ and whether these meta-concepts make sense in the hyper-nuanced complexities of our world today.

I do this in two parts: 

1. I perform visual semiotic analysis by researching and compiling a moving image archive dealing with the depiction and representation of violence: consisting of video clips ranging from archival war footage, film clips, documentary footage, advertisements, news clips, landscape panoramas, and home videos. I categorise the types of violence represented in this archive and create a violence intensity map. 
2. The artistic component of Purgatory EDIT uses a portable EEG home kit (Emotiv Epoc X) designed to read brainwave activity as emotions. A proprietary software translates these emotional mind-states into usable parameters linked to the intensity map values. The created device serves as a ‘fuzzy controller’, where a real-time reading of their emotions allows participants to control a real-time juxtaposition of the clips.

By providing individual ‘scenes’ in the form of pre-curated footage, and an innovative device that uses brainwaves to control the montage-based conceptual narrative – the installation as a technomediated digital performance generates a sequence of videos in ongoing, ever-changing permutations, thereby creating a seamless, non-looping, unending, and unique cinematic experience – every time it is accessed. 

The fact that this device is difficult to control with precision allows participants varying degrees of looseness and the ability to ‘play’ with the process. As participants struggle to obtain a degree of control, trying to will their subconscious into creating specific sequences, often attempts to soothe/agitate their minds has unexpected results: while a relaxed and meditative state of mind brings forward conflict-oriented video clips, a more agitated state, or frustration as a mood would be reflected in showing more peaceful scenes. Squinting the eyes causes blurring while clenching of the jaws temporarily pauses the sequence, and blinking causes a rupture from the War and Peace binary by toggling advertisements, and Kanye West music videos – another form of violence altogether.

As an archive and a playful installation, Purgatory EDIT casts the participant as a critical spectator and a witness – not to the macro tides of history, but to the fate of those invisibilised and marginalised within these histories of power relations, where “\[T]he humanism of the Black Wave films can be located in their siding with the downtrodden.” As a participatory installation, it foregrounds the use and potential of experimental cutting-edge technologies and invites its audience to access cinematic experiences through innovative modes of playfulness and care.
