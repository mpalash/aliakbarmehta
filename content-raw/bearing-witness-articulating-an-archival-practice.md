summary: >-
  We are living in the age of ‘Planetary Entanglement’ where violence is a
  fundamental condition at the core of the human experience, in which we are
  bound to ask, *How to work through the methods and processes of
  decolonisation, while being assaulted with new forms of colonial, or
  neo-colonial practices – whether social, political, or economic – on a regular
  basis? How to learn, to adapt to a historical timeline of struggle against
  hegemonic power, while unlearning the fundamental biases within the
  foundations of one’s own being?*

T & E's summer double number 1-2 / 2022 has been published! The issue focuses on Marxist thinking about the economic crisis, examines Thomas Piketty's latest work, and reviews anti-deconstruction political rhetoric in France. The series of debates on the state of social theory that has sparked debate continues. 

In their editorials, Ari Korhonen, M.Sc. (Econ.), And Katariina Mäkinen, M.Sc. Multidisciplinarity describes, on the one hand, the agile decision-making capacity of science and, on the other, the critical approach to research that destabilizes the definitions and boundaries of disciplines. Miika Kabata, M.Sc. (Econ.), And Otto Kyyrönen, M.Sc. In the speeches of the issue, the collection of several articles compiled by Professor Risto Heiskala opens the discussion with the recent publications of Thomas Piketty, who has become world-famous in the 21st century. 

In her review, Docent Martta Heikkilä explains the political debate in France in recent years about the threat posed to the French national idea by so-called “Islamic-leftism”, deconstruction and decolonial thinking. Olivia Maury, PhD, will continue the series on the social theory of science & progress, answering Mikko J. Virtanen's introductory speech "Where did you go, social theory?" with the counter-question: "Where are you hiding, social theory?" According to Maury, “we need local, Arctic, global, and multilingual social theory, and everything in between, because our society — our common planetary life — needs discussion across and against scientific and state boundaries”.
