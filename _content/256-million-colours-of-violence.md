256 Million Colours of Violence is an interactive and participatory survey-based artistic project ([www.256millioncoloursofviolence.com](http://www.256millioncoloursofviolence.com/)) that challenges political-religious-socio-economic quadrangle to create new visual vocabulary where participants become co-archivists. Through 77 questions on gender, race, ethnicity, privilege, social class, minimum wage, & other pressing issues, participants seek & share subliminal associations of ‘Colours of Violence’.
