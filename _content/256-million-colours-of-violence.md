## Where do you fit in the larger scheme of things? Is your citizenship made doubtful? Is your right to live questioned? Does the question, ‘Where are you from?’, seem like a violent intrusion normalized through repetition?

By transforming the commonplace [survey questionnaire](http://www.256millioncoloursofviolence.com/participate) into a diverse communication interface, the project subverts the problematic usage of questionnaires as bureaucratic tools for data collection. With particular emphasis on questions of gender, sexuality, class, and citizenship, it reveals the presence of violence – in routine everyday questions, and in everyday life. Through 50 questions gathered from various bureaucratic forms, the project facilitates an ‘encounter of equals’ and serves as a witness, a therapist, and a mirror, creating a new vocabulary of colour in the context of violence.

This project provides an unparalleled glimpse into the complex cosmological relationship of ourselves as both victim and perpetrator of the violence and trauma surrounding us. Based on four years of research, it focuses on the culmination of a hyper-researched archive of notes embedded within the questionnaire. This archive delves into ‘the normalised, normative, the disproved-yet-in-practice, the banal, obscure, unheard of, and the unthinkable’ to reveal ‘direct, structural, and cultural’ [1] violence present in everyday life and elicit ‘knowledge systems’ that reproduce and sustain the ecology of violence. The glossary styled archive compiles the variegated aspects of our identities that are daily scrutinized, questioned and thrown back to us as everyday confrontations. Asking online audiences to participate is to ask them to confront these tangible and abstract concepts and emerge undefeated.

Although 256 Million Colours of Violence began as a response to the specific events unfolding after the historic [Malegaon Blasts (2008, India)](http://www.256millioncoloursofviolence.com/texts/historical-context), this response has grown to encompass several other events in a world that is radically changing. As a Conceptual Art project, the website becomes the primary site of negotiation between the participant and the questions that characterise everyday violence. As a site of negotiation inviting active participation, it reshapes the individual online experience into an emotionally charged private performance of confrontation and healing. Bound to the aesthetics of technical and legal information infrastructures, to neural networks, mindmaps, and internet protocols, the project invites a critique of these architectures of control by creating an open-source and free platform for the simple sharing of [colour](http://www.256millioncoloursofviolence.com/colours).

The project as an ongoing archive will also commission and produce [essays and texts](http://www.256millioncoloursofviolence.com/texts) that orbit themes and subjects regarding the ways in which we conceive of violence and counter it.
