'Narrating WAR' performed at Forum Mall, Turku, during the **[New Performance Turku, Festival 2020: Mobilities](http://newperformance.fi/ali-akbar-mehta/?lang=en)**, Turku

Ali Akbar Mehta together with Helsinki based artist-duo ***[varialambo](https://varialambo.com/)*** conduct 'Narrating War', a four-hour performance coupled with a site-specific installation, reading from the War List Codex, an excerpt of all conflicts from 2000-2020

> Narrating WAR is an invitation to imagine a relationship between the ‘known’ and the ‘unknown’ of our collective human history. It is an ongoing series of performance readings of a comprehensive list of ‘wars, battles, sacks, sieges, revolts, revolutions, bombings and insurgencies – from 3000 BC to the present’ that provides a comprehensive tableau of a history of human beings as a continuous history of violence and conflict. The performance reading at the New Performance Turku Festival, tells a story from which emerges an intense voyage rooted in that first war, leading to the most recent conflict – laying open the reality of it not being the last one either. The complete reading of this list takes over 12 days, and the current 4-hour iteration in Turku, performed in collaboration with *varialambo,* will focus on conflicts from the year 2000 to the present.
