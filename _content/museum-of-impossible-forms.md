> In the Autumn of 2016, several artists, curators, philosophers, theorists and cultural workers attempted to respond to the gaping void of Independent and artist-run spaces within Helsinki. This collective, the **[Museum of Impossible Forms](https://museumofimpossibleforms.org/)**, applied for a grant from **Kone Foundation** for funding to conceive, launch and run a space in Kontula, Helsinki. A decision to house ourselves in a space previously occupied by a Night School, allowed us to to evolve from a space of exhibition to a space focusing on 'Alternate Pedagogy', and respond to the unmet needs of the City, where a space of and gathering of the subaltern may take place, without the toxic presence of prejudice and the overbearing sense of anxiety.

> **Museum of Impossible Forms** (m{*if*}) is a cultural centre located in Kontula, East-Helsinki. For us the Museum is a space in flux – a contested space representing a contact zone, a space of unlearning, formulating identity constructs, norm-critical consciousness and critical thinking, already containing within it the potential for the *para museum*, the *counter museum*, the *anti museum*. ‘Impossible Forms’ are those that facilitate the process of transgressing the boundaries/borders between art, politics, practice, theory, the artist and the spectator.
>
> Museum of Impossible Forms was founded in spring 2017 as an antiracist and queer-feminist project, a heterogeneous space, and as an experimental and migrant form of expression. Envisioned as a response to the issues of the margins, but also the marginalisation of time, space, and bodies – to shift the site of culture away from a centralised & elitist position. As a free space, M{*if*} is a method for making visible the cultures of the margins, by engaging the performativity of its own culture and as a contemporary institution remaking its own center.

> Museum of Impossible Forms opens up a broad horizon though its political character, its accessibility and openness, its multilingual ***[library](https://museumofimpossibleforms.org/library)***, an ongoing ***[archive](https://museumofimpossibleforms.org/archives)***, and through its ***[workshops and events](https://museumofimpossibleforms.org/events)***. It is the coming together of a collective of people – an independent group of Helsinki-based artists, curators, pedagogists, philosophers and facilitators art and cultural workers who believe in the need for this space. It consists of Marianne Savallampi, Ali Akbar Mehta, Ahmed Al-Nawas, Raine Aiava, Vidha Saumya, Danai A. Anagnostou, Vishnu Vardhani Rajan, Heidi Hänninen, Soko Hwang, Zahrah Ehsan.

> Museum of Impossible Forms is currently (2019-2020) operating under the curatorial theme of ‘***[The Atlas of Lost Beliefs (For Insurgents, Citizens and Untitled Bodies)](https://museumofimpossibleforms.org/atlas-of-lost-beliefs)***’ – where again we renew our commitment and solidarity with ‘fellow insurgents, citizens, and untitled bodies’ – as the cast of our collective narratives, who are all trying to swim in contaminated circumstances, to stay afloat in the infinite waters of precarity, seeking footing despite their groundlessness, subaltern characters not so very different from all of us. We are or have been each of them at some point in time, often all three, simultaneously, silently. This cast – who frame and address the engagement of cultural production with political and cultural predicaments in locations not ‘their own’, whether described from a narrowly territorial point of view or within the contexts of secular, transnational, democratic, decolonial, queer, norm critical world(s) – allow us to ask, *‘What comes next?’*
