> In the Autumn of 2016, several artists, curators, philosophers, theorists and cultural workers attempted to respond to the gaping void of Independent and artist-run spaces within Helsinki. This collective, the **[](https://museumofimpossibleforms.org/)Museum of Impossible Forms** applied for a grant from Kone Foundation for funding to conceive, launch and run a space in Kontula, Helsinki. A decision to house ourselves in a space previously occupied by a Night School, allowed us to to evolve from a space of exhibition to a space focusing on 'Alternate Pedagogy', and respond to the unmet needs of the City, where a space of and gathering of the subaltern may take place, without the toxic presence of prejudice and the overbearing sense of anxiety.

> > **[Museum of Impossible Forms](https://museumofimpossibleforms.org/)**  (m{*if*}) is a cultural centre located in Kontula, East-Helsinki. For us the Museum is a space in flux – a contested space representing a contact zone, a space of unlearning, formulating identity constructs, norm-critical consciousness and critical thinking, already containing within it the potential for the *para museum*, the *counter museum*, the *anti museum*. ‘Impossible Forms’ are those that facilitate the process of transgressing the boundaries/borders between art, politics, practice, theory, the artist and the spectator.

Museum of Impossible Forms - M{if} was founded by an independent group of Helsinki artists/ curators/ philosophers/ activists/ pedagogists in spring 2017 as an antiracist and queer-feminist project, a heterogeneous space, and as an experimental and migrant form of expression. The Museum of Impossible Forms opens up a broad horizon though its political character, its accessibility and openness, its multilingual ***[library](https://museumofimpossibleforms.org/library)***, an ongoing ***[archive](https://museumofimpossibleforms.org/archives)***, and through its ***[workshops and events](https://museumofimpossibleforms.org/events)***.
