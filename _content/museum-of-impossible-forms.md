In the Autumn of 2016, several artists, curators, philosophers, theorists and cultural workers attempted to respond to the gaping void  of Independent and artist run spaces within the city of Helsinki. 

This collective, [**The Museum of Impossible Forms**](https://museumofimpossibleforms.org/), applied for a grant from **Kone Foundation** for funding to conceive, launch and run a space in Kontual, Helsinki.

A decision to house ourselves in a space previously occupied by a Night School, allowed us to to evolve from a space of exhibition to a space focusing on 'Alternate Pedagogy', and respond to the unmet needs of the City, where a space of and gathering of the Subaltern may take place, without the toxic presence of prejudice and the overbearing sense of anxiety. 

> Museum of Impossible Forms is a cultural center located in Kontula in East Helsinki. The space facilitates the process of transgressing boundaries/borders between art, politics, practice, theory, the artist and the spectator. The Museum of Impossible Forms is a space in flux, a platform for experiences and a laboratory of thought.
