In the Autumn of 2016, several artists, curators, philosophers, theorists and cultural workers attempted to respond to the gaping void of Independent and artist-run spaces within Helsinki. This collective, **[The Museum of Impossible Forms](https://museumofimpossibleforms.org/)**, applied for a grant from **Kone Foundation** for funding to conceive, launch and run a space in Kontula, Helsinki.

A decision to house ourselves in a space previously occupied by a Night School, allowed us to to evolve from a space of exhibition to a space focusing on 'Alternate Pedagogy', and respond to the unmet needs of the City, where a space of and gathering of the subaltern may take place, without the toxic presence of prejudice and the overbearing sense of anxiety.

> Museum of Impossible Forms is a cultural center located in Kontula in East Helsinki. The space facilitates the process of transgressing boundaries/borders between art, politics, practice, theory, the artist and the spectator. The Museum of Impossible Forms is a space in flux, a platform for experiences and a laboratory of thought.
