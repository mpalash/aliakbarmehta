In the Autumn of 2016, several artists, curators, philosophers, theorists and cultural workers attempted to respond to the gaping void  of Independant and artist run spaces within the city of Helsinki. 

This collective, [**The Museum of Impossible Forms**](https://museumofimpossibleforms.org/), applied for a grant from **Kone Foundation** for funding to concieve, launch and run a space in Kontual, Helsinki.

For me, the Museum of Impossible Forms respinds to the unmet needs of the City, where a space of 'Alternate Pedagogy' and gathering of the Subaltern may take place, without prejudice and the overbearing sense of anxiety.
