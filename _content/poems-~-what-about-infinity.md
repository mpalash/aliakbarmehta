**I**

A streak of white light
In the dark recesses of my mind,
Blinded, I hear…
A noise, a thud.
Again, again with every beat
A sound within, A pulse
Blending across
The soft membrane of the body.
Soft music, slightly building
Black, red, pink peach, yellow,
First sensations, warm
Floating and secure,
Separated from myself
By time and space.

**II**

The day meets the night,
As the Sun touches the Moon…
And the stars dance around
Amidst psychedelic clouds
Of purple, mauve and gold.
Where am I? What am I doing here?
Cracks, cobwebs and fairy dust
Wires, cables and tape
Ash, rubble and black roses,
Odds and ends, junk –
The leftovers from the yesteryears,
Mementos of a timeless memory
And an age forgotten
Before we became men


**III**

We are who we are,
But who are we, we know not
But we are who we are,
The Blind balanced monsters of the Idd
Stitching up the wounds of the soul
I prepare to go at it again
I sit, stand and lie down
I go round and round
Coming back to where I start
Again and again, it’s the same spot
Day by day, and in helpless nights
Watching the clouds pass me by
I think and I think
Wondering how it will all end
And then I think that first I should begin

**IV**

You sit on your high and mighty throne
Of concrete metal and stone
Unperturbed, unmoved
Wise and confused…
What of us, the lesser beings
The commoners and the fools
Those who seek sustenance
And those who seek nothing at all?
What path leads you?
What path leads to you?
How many questions must be asked
For one answer?
How long is forever?
