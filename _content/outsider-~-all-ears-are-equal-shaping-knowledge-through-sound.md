Tuike and Simo Alitalo are sound artists based in Turku, Finland. Their practice involves sound installations based on field recordings, environmental art, writing, participatory performances as well as communal sound performances and listening walks. Exploring the ways places are heard, their work emerges from the central questions of ‘acoustemology’, i.e. acoustic epistemology, questioning, “What do we experience through sound, listening and other auditive practices? How is our knowledge shaped by the things we hear in our surroundings?” Programs made by Simo Alitalo for Radio Broadcasting now in Yle Arena. “Simo Alitalo (b. 1954) has been one of the key players in the Radio Broadcasting and its predecessor the Radio program, which naturally joined Alitalo’s work as a sound artist. Alitalo’s work is humorous, intellectual, cultural-conscious and sound-oriented, while simultaneously and ironically questions the media itself.” We speak to Tuike and Simo Alitalo to explore together their experiences regarding practice, work, their methods, and their living.
