  Memory and Maximum City was one of my first talks as an artist. Here I
  presented some of the work shown during SITE : STAGE : STRUCTURE, a transmedia
  archival installation of my four year engagement with Mazgaon and its several
  microcommunities. At this talk I spoke about the process of how my journey
  with this project began and in the subsequent conversation with members of the
  audience and fellow speakers, discussed the importance of alternative methods
  of history-building and the importance of oral histories.
