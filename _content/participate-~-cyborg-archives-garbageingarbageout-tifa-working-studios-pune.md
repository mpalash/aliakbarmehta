Members of the audience were invited to participate 'in the archive' by interacting with \[the simplified manifestation of a cyber] archive through a series of controlled statements and requests. 'The archive', in this case performed by Luv Mehtani, was bound by a scripted introductory and closing statements, and with instructions to invite questions/statements from the audience
