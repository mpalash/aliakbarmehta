> Moscow-based Partizaning collective is an urban activist movement focusing on art as a tool for social change. Two collective members, Anton Polskiy and Natalia Sinitsina were hosted by m-cult to create Partizaning Maunula, an intervention focusing on mechanisms of exclusion in the neighbourhood.
>
> In collaboration with artists from Aalto Universityâ€™s VICCA MA progamme, Partizaning created a series of interventions to address the parallel dynamics of gentrification and segregation in the Maunula neighbourhood.
