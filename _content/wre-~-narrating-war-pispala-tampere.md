  This reading from the book took place at The Memorial of the Red Guards, who
  died during the Finnish Civil War in Pispala, Tampere. The inscription in the
  stone says, ‘On this Pispala ridge, the Red Guard in Tampere last stood with
  weopans in hand defending their cause in 1918’.

The project is ongoing and a copy of the book in its current state is donated to the Pispala Library on the occasion of the exhibition, ‘Where does poetry nest?’, on 6th September, 2016 in memory of the over 5000 year old Civil War that the world, it seems, has not seen enough of.
