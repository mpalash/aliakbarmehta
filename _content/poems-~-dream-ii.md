Passing a herd of flying baby pink elephants,

Dragons of fire and ice

A lake in the middle of nowhere

Of milk and honey and chocolate and coke

Marshmallow lotus

The bird is burning

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust

Here come the comedians

The jesters and the fools

A procession, a fair,

Fun and mirth are in the air

Beyond, the clouds are stirring,

Beware, the light is fading.

The drums start beating, thundering

And blend into the noise of war.

Soon, the gunmen shall arrive

The sound of their march drown

The jesters and the fools

The tents will be empty,

For all eternity

My world will succumb to the

Voices of reason

The phoenix has flown
