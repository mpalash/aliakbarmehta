  From January 5, to Febuary 6, 2018, I was invited with several other artists

  the ARTEL2018, TIFA Working Studios.

The curatorial framework, set by artist/curator Vidisha Fadescha was "To Participate in the Archive".

During my month-long residency, I interacted with my fellow residents, volunteers and employees of the residency and produced new work and reproduced some old work.

Overall, it was an opportunity to consolidate my practice within the lens of 'archiving as artistic praxis' and has been the instrumental towards helping me formulate and consolodate several notes for my thesis "Cyber Archive: Being and Doing Knowledge".
