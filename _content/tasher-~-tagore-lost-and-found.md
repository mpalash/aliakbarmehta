Tasher Desh (Kingdom of Cards), 2012, Lenticular print and vinyl on archival board, 88 x 114 cm

> "Rabindranath Tagore was inspired by Alice in Wonderland and Western opera when he wrote the dance opera ‘Tasher Desh’ - a satirical portrayal of a society ruled by strict conventions and a veiled criticism of the society he lived in."

The Kingdom of Cards depicted here is a reality embodied in today’s world. The intertwined strands of the orthodox and the liberal, and our society’s continuing failure to separate the two have created a dual discourse – a conflict between the real and fictional – the visible and invisible – the actual and the aspirational.
