In 2018, I was invited by Visual Cultures, Curating, and Contemporary Art, Aalto University, Helsinki, as a Guest Lecturer, to talk about 'Cyber Archives', in the context of Archiving as a method to create 'Histories of the Present'.

The lecture was a introduction to Archives, and archival praxis within Contemporary Art. It was followed by a workshop styled course, and the culmination of this course can be found [here](http://vicca.fi/journal/histories-in-the-present/).
