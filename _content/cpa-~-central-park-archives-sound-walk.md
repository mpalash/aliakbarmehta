summary: >-
  The **pilot phase** of *Central Park Archives* culminated with a launch of the
  interface and a curated walk that demonstrated the workings of the website
  interface, in the Allotment gardens of Maunula's Central Park. 


  Artists **Susanna Ånäs** and **Ali Akbar Mehta**, in collaboration with **Arun Ganesh** from Mapbox and technical support from **Palash Mukhopadhyay**, developed a locative map interface as part of their **[M-cult Residency](https://aliakbarmehta.com/content/central-park-archives#central-park-archives-announcement)** in Maunula.


  Visitors experienced the archive on-site, by walking in the forest. Through the walk, the audience/participants explored the hybridised physical+digital space through stories, interviews, and ambient soundscapes presented as audio files, as well as photographs and archive documents. Through the website's "exploration mode" they found the mapped elements by following the increasing volume of the sounds as they grew nearer and other directions provided by the interface. With aerial photos from previous decades, the map interface also makes visible the geographical changes to the Park, the Maunula area, and its surroundings.

The first collections include *Allotment Stories*, *Flying Squirrel Mating Games*, *General Plan 2050 Protests*, and a selection of *Maunulan Sanomat* newspaper stories about the Central Park. The collections of sounds and photographs were edited by **Kalle Kuisma**, **Iida Nissinen**, and **Minna Tarkka** with contributions from **Susanna Pitkänen** and **Antti Viren**. Further material will continue to be processed and added to later editions of the interface.
