## WAR • ROOM • ECHO: Regarding the pain of other Cyborgs

is a collaborative Transmedia Performance-Installation and Research Project examining the philosophical terrain of war that addresses the current situation of a permanent state of conflict across the globe, and addresses violent incidents in the world not as isolated events but as a new condition of an ongoing, unparalleled warfare.

Examining the philosophical terrain of war, WAR • ROOM • ECHO features drawn images and sounds related to war, and the impact war has on the human mind. This way the project is more than a simple representation of war, where it instead describes war as a universal idea of human antagonism – a set of languages and iconographies embedded in our everyday lives and broader social consciousness. Dealing beyond an actual, specific conflict, it confronts its audience with the unpalatable side of humanity, the scenes and situations that resist engagement.

The vision of the project is to bring together (i) a 30 x 40 ft. site-specific charcoal drawing on War performed as an act of mourning, viewed in a dark room with torchlight; (ii) a performance reading and typing of a 5019 year long 'War List' of every War, Battle, Revolution, Rebellion, Siege, Sacking and Insurgency; (iii) a data generated soundscape based on the live typing of the list; (iv) cameras that automatically take photographs when triggered by the soundscape, creating a continual photographic documentation transforming the viewer into an active performer; and (v) a memorial style installation of the War List mimicking vertical graves.

The project is envisioned as a temporary museum – as a hybrid cross between an archaeological site (in itself a branch or a parallel of history), a war memorial, and a tomb. It is a gesamtkunstwerk on the idea of war and conflict, creating a significant marker in the form of the largest war based research archive spanning 5019 years, beyond existing notions of geo-political identity – positing the project in the context of a PARA-museum that critically engages and disrupts existing power relations.
