'WAR • ROOM • ECHO: Regarding the pain of other Cyborgs' is a unique collaborative Transmedia Performance-Installation and Research Project. It is a _gesamtkunstwerk_ on the idea of war and conflict that brings together:

1. A 30 x 40 ft. site-specific charcoal drawing on War, viewed in a dark room with torchlight;
2. A performance reading and typing of a 5117 year long ‘War List’ of every War, Battle, Revolution, Rebellion, Siege, Sacking and Insurgency;
3. A data generated soundscape based on the live typing of the list;
4. Cameras that automatically take photographs when triggered by the soundscape, creating a continual photographic documentation transforming the viewer into an active performer; and
5. A memorial style installation of the War List mimicking vertical graves.
