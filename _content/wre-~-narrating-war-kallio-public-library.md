  A 3 minute excerpt of my radio performance, which was a One Hour Reading
  session of Wars from 2000 to 2011, at Kallio Public Library as part of
  Chimurenga’s Pan African Space Station live radio broadcast.

null.void; 

// a sermon of nothingness and a space odyssey of zero movement and tycho magnetic anomalies

null.void; is a Transmedia Performance-lecture recitation and Research Project. It comprises a procedural audio soundscape of glitch sounds using static and radio frequencies, and a performance recitation of a comprehensive list of every war, battle, siege, sacking, revolt and revolution spanning 5014 years of human conflict and violence.

\*null.void will eventually become a part of a currently-in-developement project titled 'WAR • ROOM• ECHO: Regarding the Pain of Other Cyborgs'.
