A 3 minute excerpt of my radio performance, which was a One Hour Reading
session of Wars from 2000 to 2011, at Kallio Public Library as part of
Chimurenga’s Pan African Space Station live radio broadcast.

null.void; is a Transmedia Performance-lecture recitation and Research Project. It comprises a procedural audio soundscape of glitch sounds using static and radio frequencies, and a performance recitation of a comprehensive list of every _war, battle, siege, sacking, revolt and revolution, bombing and insurgency_ spanning 5014 years of human conflict and violence.

null.void will eventually become a part of a currently-in-developement project titled 'WAR • ROOM• ECHO: Regarding the Pain of Other Cyborgs'.
