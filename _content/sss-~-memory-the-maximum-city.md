**Tell us about your association with Godrej India Culture Lab**

Well, this is my first project with Godrej India Culture Lab. They had seen the project when it was being exhibited at The Clark House Initiative, which is an Artist Initiative, an alternate space to the Gallery system. I think when a plan was devised to do this talk; my work and I were invited to be a part of it.

Having said that, I was graciously given a tour of the various spaces and projects that are an ongoing part of Godrej, within and outside of the Culture Lab. I am very excited with the potential a space like this holds for the city and an artist like me, and I hope to have a lasting relationship with them.



**What ‘Memory & The Maximum City’ means for you?**

Memories matter in any day and age – I believe in the saying, “Those who forget history, are bound to repeat it”. In the context of the city and its people, the easiest thing would be to forget people who live beyond the perimeter of our immediate vision, but in doing so we condemn ourselves to be forgotten by others.

How many of us know the basic history of Bombay?  Does it matter? Does it matter whether we knew or not what happened? How important is it to know that Bombay Docks started in 1735 or that _Tarla House_ became J.J. hospital or that a structure such as _Hasanabad_ exists, or the story of _Pine Building_.  At the end of the day the specifics may not matter. But what is important is that there is a sense of identity that we’re losing and that reflects in the way we live; it reflects in how we conduct ourselves; and it is reflecting in the way Mazgaon is changing. The experience of Mazgaon changing through time and space is what is seen in the exhibition.

One of the things I like reminding people that Mazgaon has been a host to a number of different communities, _Sutari Gujratis_, _Bohri_ Muslims, Catholics, _Parsis_, Davidian Jews, Israelis and Chinese. Mazgaon represented a true cosmopolitan city – The kind we have always imagined it to be. Such projects enrich Mumbai’s art scene by offering something other than aesthetic wall-hangings and floor pieces, or theory-laden group shows. In an era in which right-wing groups continue to insist on Mumbai narrowly as a 'Hindu Marathi City', counter-historical practices like Site : Stage : Structure serve much more than ethnographic curiosity.



**The whole event is set on the backdrop of nostalgic tour of Mumbai. What do you have to say about this?**

I don’t think that any of the projects being showcased and discussed are engaging with sentimental nostalgia. I believe the importance of the work being done by these projects hits home in a very different way. Speaking for the project and myself, here I fight nostalgia by documenting it, recreating it through videos, conversations and staging ethnographic reconstructions of people’s homes. It is a Transmedia Installation that integrates books, objects, photographs, short films, audio narratives, and heritage walks as a way of revitalizing memories and telling a history that is absent from the formal narratives.



**What message do you aim to deliver with this project?**

Mazgaon is a port and dock area of Mumbai with a rich heritage and complex history. An integral and once central part of the city seems to be almost abandoned, its history neglected, its heritage slowly corroded by the passages of Time and the amnesia of people.

A fairy tale, the origin of a deity, stories of old men recounting childhood and parents, origins of their home, recounting of a 75 year old friendship that lasted relocation to Calcutta and back, the memories of ‘Paradise Lost’ – accounts that do not enter a formal narrative – information that in the grander scheme of things seem not as important, but which we cannot afford to forget.

These are not just stories of Bombay in itself, or the way Mazgaon has changed. Mazgaon is exemplary of the way several spaces/places in the country and the world are changing – silently, and without our knowing about it.  It is like a falling teacup that we don’t see till it shatters. Fortunately Mazgaon and other places like that haven’t shattered yet. But they’re falling. It is up to us how soon we can look at them and how soon we can arrest that fall.



**Your work from Site: Stage: Structure will also be showcased at the event. What do you have to say on that?**

Departing from a usual format of talks and lecture, The Godrej India Culture Lab has made available an opportunity to be able to experience first hand, an example of the kind of project the speakers will be talking about. I feel this will give the audience and the viewers a better chance at understanding the work and hopefully the importance of staging ethnographic interventions. At the same time, I hope that the presence of these works will be an icebreaker and facilitating a better dialogue with the artist and speakers present.



**Tell us about your journey as an artist.**

I was born in Mumbai, 1983. I studied painting at The Sir J.J. School of Art, Mumbai. I make contemporary art, films, books, collaborate with robotic engineers, computer programmers, musicians, writers, theater and film makers and aim to found processes that would leave deep impacts on contemporary culture, technology and knowledge.  

Some of the mundane activities that I have been a part of are ‘**Site : Stage : Structure’**, a solo exhibition integrating books, photographs, video documentation, audio narratives and heritage walks as a way of revitalizing memories and telling a history that is absent from the formal narratives, at The Clark House Initiative, Mumbai; as well as '**Ballad of the War that Never Was, and other Bastardized Myths**', a solo exhibition of drawings, paintings and digital works, held at Tao Art Gallery, Mumbai in 2011; as well as recent group exhibitions at Tao Art Gallery, Mumbai; Art Heritage, New Delhi; and Galerie Mirchandani + Steinruecke, Mumbai.



**Why had you chosen Mazgaon and Wadibunder for your project?**

Mazgaon has been important to me – my grandparents have lived in Mazgaon for 42 years, for more than my entire life. During school summer vacations, I visited their home and was taken to the famous Mazgaon Gardens. The Garden located on a hilltop offers stunning views of the docks, the ships and the urban landscape of Mazgaon, Wadibunder and beyond. This vivid memory has remained with me and I was keen to revisit the space now as an artist. The beginnings of the project were purely personal, but speaking to local historians and members of the various communities, slowly I realized the vast history and the rich heritage of Mazgaon and Wadibunder. I knew then, that I needed to make this accessible to a larger audience.

This project has connected me intimately with various people, strangers whose lives are an open book to me. I realized how something as intangible as a community could be reflected very concretely in architecture, colours and spaces, and most importantly in the people, those who hold on and treasure its past as well as those who look towards its future.
