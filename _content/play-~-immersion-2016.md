Note on Documentation:
This Documentation is for recordkeeping only – It is not the Work of art.
The Work is Temporary and Transient, as is our use of the space.
No fixed time will be announced for the performance, but allow for an open-ended organic performance – To last as long as it feels necessary.

Each performance will be unique, keeping in mind a similar flow of sound growth.
Pause and silence are as important as sound/noise themselves
Performance will also be open to participation by viewers
