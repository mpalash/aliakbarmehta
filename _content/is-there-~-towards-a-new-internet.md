The current iteration of the Internet is a dystopian and hegemonic space – a tool deployed to facilitate *marketability*– with the knowledge that the internet is the best (economic) ‘value production’ space.

**Ali Akbar Mehta** and **Palash Mukhopadhyay** discuss the need for [256 Million Colours of Violence](http://www.256millioncoloursofviolence.com/) as an ongoing inquiry embedded in digital media and contemporary social culture – one that focuses on the political instrumentalization of the tools, techniques, and infrastructures of the web, with particular attention to the manipulation of information to shape opinion, and the importance of nurturing new communities that by recognising the everyday presence of violence are able to further the necessary discourses that counter violence and challenge the precarity of their own social and political positions.

This is the fourth conversation live streamed as part of the exhibition 'Is there a room with just a colour?', at [Myymaälaä2](https://www.myymala2.com/), Helsinki.
