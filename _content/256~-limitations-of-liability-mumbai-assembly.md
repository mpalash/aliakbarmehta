The project is displayed in Mumbai for the first time, in 2017.

As a traveling project across venues, the project in its iteration at Mumbai Assembly is conceptualised to be a space for discourse and conversation. This translated as three events, each a dialogue with an invited speaker to collectively reflect on violence in its various forms by forming symbiotic relationships with each otherâ€™s praxes.
