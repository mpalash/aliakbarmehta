Throbbing –Alive.

Spreading branches –Roots

Pushing –its limits

Expanding.

Evolving

As if sprouting into –

Something else, self.

Touch of a Butterfly –A spark, frivolous.

Movement, dance

The cosmic beat –

Millisecond of enlightenment.

The withering flower

The setting Sun

Nirvana of everyday life…
