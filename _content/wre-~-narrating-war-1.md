'Narrating WAR – Performance Reading', 2019, as part of group exhibition, 'Relational Figures', Mymmälä2, Helsinki, Finland

In the two-day performance reading, 'Narrating War', I read excerpts from the text, 'WAR LIST CODEX', as part of the group exhibition and performance series, 'Relational Figures', at Myymälä2. The reading narrates a history of war, conflict, and violence as the most continuous, omnipresent and ongoing history of humanity – a civil war on a planetary scale.
