[Luminous Matter](http://luminousmatter.in/) is a collaborative experimental short film, set in a parallel post-apocalyptic present, where mankind no longer exists. In a world covered with nuclear fog and left to total ruin, a rapidly evolving race of uranium-based life forms called Ouraosteus have emerged.

\    \[ Ouraostes from Greek oὐρανός, Ouranos "Uranus" and οστεος, osteus "bone" ]

This stop motion animated short follows the story of the last survivor of an endangered species called Ouraosteus Lutessentia who is being hunted down by a superior predatorily race of Ouraosteus Ablissentia.

\    \[Lutessentia from Latin luteus "yellow as gold or fire" and essentia "essence" ] \[Albissentia from Latin albidus " white " and essentia "essence"]

The last Lutessentia has stumbled upon the “house of the forgotten” and the key to its survival and evolution.
