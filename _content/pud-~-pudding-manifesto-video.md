  The making of the rice pudding (Riisipuuro/Kheer) is overlapped by the audio
  of interviews of visitors to the exhibition "Refugee, Evacuee, Migrant"
  (Finnish National Museum, 2016).


  During the interview, members of the audience are asked about their responses
  to the exhibition, their feelings towards the cureent refugee crisis, and
  their own memories of events of migration.
