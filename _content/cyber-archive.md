Cyber archive is less of an artistic project, more of a curatorial framework: inviting the reader to consider the Archive, as a narrative, a repository, a state-tool, a fact, a fiction, both as a site and trope for artistic inquiry and art production; to define our protagonist: the User (of the Cyber Archives) as an artist/curator/archivist, a combination of a historian, researcher, performer, participant, interventionist, collaborator, urban denizen, and spy. 

The thesis is presented as a _cyberpsychogeographical_ archive situated in and as a cluster of cyber relations, [here](https://graphcommons.com/selections/491666f1-ed4c-457e-b318-7e27a7558647). 

Thus, it performs its own validation by actualising the possibilities of non-linear and cyclic time that are the relevant ‘features’ of a metadata-driven, hyperconnected archive that resides in cyberspace and uses a digital interface. It provides a framework for asking a series of questions. If an archive may have several meanings, then this archive is also an archive of questions one may have, or should have, about archives. Questions sustain a critical perspective of both praxes and research, and so if an archive has no end, this archive may be an ongoing process of archiving questions till the very end (of archives).
