Of Men and Supermen is about the nature of truth, the hidden and the apparent and the difference between the real and fictional.

Who are these who have been photographed? What alternate realities are being projected on them? Are their dreams and aspirations an illusion?

The performance of the everyday is an act of resistance, to help bring those who are on the periphery into the center of the gaze.

These performances enable the idea of the fictional to percolate into the realm of the real, generating a new urban metascape and transforming people into the Superheroes of their own narratives.

This body of work engages with the duality of identity, overlapping the real and the fictional, forcing them to coexist and dissolving the barrier between the two.
