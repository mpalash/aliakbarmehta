The project is an interactive performance audiovisual installation, primarily using the Emotive Epoc+ as a means to 'read' the viewer’s sub conscious and semiconscious mind-states such as frustration, anxiety and excitement. These mind-states are calibrated to software and are used to generate a unique cinematic experience for each viewer. While frustration might bring forward more horrific images, a more relaxed and a meditative state of mind would be reflected in showing more peaceful scenes.

A collaborative work with artist Jernej Čuček Gerbec (Slovenia), Purgatory is an interactive performance installation. Operating within the simplified binary of War and Peace, the installation uses the participant’s state of mind to sequence and juxtapose a series of videos in ongoing, ever-changing permutations, thereby creating a non-looping, unending, unique cinematic experience, everytime it is accessed. Tapping into the User/participant’s mind-state by using a wireless EEG (Emotiv Epoc+) machine that enables the software to access emotional states such as frustration, anxiety, excitement etc. and use this data as parameters to control the flow of video sequence. These videos range from archival war footage, film clips, documentary footage, advertisements, news clips, landscape panoramas and home videos. The intensity of footage change, intensity of violence depicted, type of violence, as well as speed, fluctuations and glitch are all affected by the brainwaves of the user, who views the ‘livestream’ through VR (Virtual Reality) headsets, while a projection plays out this performance to other viewers.
