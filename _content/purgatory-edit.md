summary: >-
  A collaborative work with artist Jernej Čuček Gerbec (Slovenia), _Purgatory
  Edit_ is a prototyping of a proof-of-concept for an interactive performance
  installation.


  The project is designed to be an interactive performance audiovisual
  installation, primarily using the Emotive Epoc+, home MRI kit that allows a
  'reading' of the viewer’s subconscious and semiconscious mind-states, such as
  frustration, anxiety and excitement. These mind-states are calibrated to VDMX
  ( VJ software) and are used to generate brainwave dependant series of images,
  creating a unique cinematic experience for each viewer. While frustration
  might bring forward more horrific images, a more relaxed and a meditative
  state of mind would be reflected in showing more peaceful scenes.

Operating within the simplified binary of War and Peace, the installation uses the participant’s state of mind to sequence and juxtapose a series of videos in ongoing, ever-changing permutations, thereby creating a non-looping, unending, unique cinematic experience -- everytime it is accessed. Tapping into the User/participant’s mind-state by using a wireless EEG (Emotiv Epoc+) machine that enables the software to access emotional states such as frustration, anxiety, excitement etc. and use this data as parameters to control the flow of video sequence. These videos range from archival war footage, film clips, documentary footage, advertisements, news clips, landscape panoramas and home videos. The intensity of footage change, intensity of violence depicted, type of violence, as well as speed, fluctuations and glitch are all affected by the brainwaves of the user, who views the ‘livestream’ through VR (Virtual Reality) headsets, while a projection plays out this performance to other viewers.
