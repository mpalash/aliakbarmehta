['Ballad of the Lost Utopian Meadow'](https://www.thelostutopianmeadow.com/) is an archive of Finnish food. The project extends the metaphorical implications of what a meadow means to Finland within the contexts of ecological conservation, cultural significance, and as a site of contemporary co-existence.

Conceived by Ali Akbar Mehta and Vidha Saumya for ONOMA summer exhibitions 2020 ‘Meadow’, curated by Taru Elfving, the 71 stanzas of the ballad have been transformed into a sound piece with vocals and piano by the amazing #varialambo (Varia Sjöström and Hatz Lambo), sound design by Kim Modig (orker), and recorded at the beautiful studios of Artlab Studio by Albert Ihanus.
