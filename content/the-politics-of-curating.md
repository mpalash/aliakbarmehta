Is it possible to make decisions in a feminist way, what to do with power? 

The talk delves into the relation of aesthetics and ethics; how is our taste "tainted" – subjective and not neutral or free of the normativity of the art field. It questions what would a decolonial and feminist aesthetics look like, and whether we can we train ourselves to like things that are better for the world, and us.
