  Welcome to **Rehearsing Hospitalities Companion 2 Readings** with Annet Dekker, and Central Park Archives artists Ali Akbar Mehta and Susanna Ånäs, hosted by the publication editors Yvonne Billimore and Jussi Koitela.

In this event, Annet Dekker is invited to present her contribution to Rehearsing Hospitalities Companion 2 “**Archival absurdity, or a walk in the park**”. Annet Dekker’s text takes us on a journey from her childhood garden with sweet berry bushes to her new allotment garden, and further onwards to think-with a speculative project based in Helsinki Central Park. Allotment Archives is a project which mirrors a real project (Central Park Archives) but remains a fictional thinking exercise. Annet’s fictitious project Allotment Archives invites us to consider different approaches for commons archiving from the artist-activist to the federative-archivist.

Following Annet’s reading, artists Susanna Ånäs and Ali Akbar Mehta from m-cult project Central Park Archives will share responses to Annet’s text in reflection with their own work. The final part of this event invites questions and responses from contributors and audiences.

A free-flowing conversation with Annet Decker, Susanna Ånäs, and myself on archival practices. Beginning with the reading of an excerpt from Annet's text, we talk about artist-archivists, federated archives, the [\#fediverse](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/fediverse?__eep__=6&__cft__[0]=AZVcEBJNH54_VHL4Oh3B-IIqS3nkieDYZlIeXPp0yFFzhpG-ZrQYuKOBYgNlZGaTzhOzGpY_UArgS9WbhkxwORUcu65wbGe8-OkeYzHQ1kvzJ7uETCTjSv7-cE4BVSbqB7XgAnaKCcIxCAEk4lxoqaXSrxSmHOervV817VnDzQRc2Bk4dCpjUkC4vYh5vwCne0_7iAfZ0609Y-sb6SuSPTq7FHLE-8Jveu5KNTGOJccgSg&__tn__=*NK-R) model, networks of care, and the importance of generating archives as a method to voice and preserve marginalised knowledges.

> This conversation came at the heels of an equally robust afternoon where we launched the prototype of our project [Keskuspuistoarkistot](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/keskuspuistoarkistot?__eep__=6&__cft__[0]=AZVcEBJNH54_VHL4Oh3B-IIqS3nkieDYZlIeXPp0yFFzhpG-ZrQYuKOBYgNlZGaTzhOzGpY_UArgS9WbhkxwORUcu65wbGe8-OkeYzHQ1kvzJ7uETCTjSv7-cE4BVSbqB7XgAnaKCcIxCAEk4lxoqaXSrxSmHOervV817VnDzQRc2Bk4dCpjUkC4vYh5vwCne0_7iAfZ0609Y-sb6SuSPTq7FHLE-8Jveu5KNTGOJccgSg&__tn__=*NK-R) / Central Park Archives: an online composite archive project seeking to preserve microhistories through generating co-archiving practices.

Together they represent the culmination of months of work, and for Susanna and I, the end of a fruitful and rich residency with M-cult.
