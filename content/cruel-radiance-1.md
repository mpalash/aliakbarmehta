More than at any other moment in human history, we are now confronted by contemporary borders manifesting as incarceration camps, penal colonies, detention facilities and refugee centres. Countries are gradually becoming prisons to confine and contain undesirable bodies. The well-being and welfare of citizens and ecology are being replaced by concerns for security and risk management. Conflicts are simply becoming tools for neo-liberal capitalism to recycle pain. Such violence leads to long-term trauma, helplessness and precarity, causing significant negative influences on our social fabric. Yet, in a hyper-digitised world, forms of violence remain invisible or unrecognised. Recognising and narrating such experiences become difficult unless we find ways to understand how violence is defined and applied across micro (interpersonal), meso (institutional), and macro (trans-societal) scales. For these processes to be known, they must be explored, visualised, satirised and challenged. 

In times where violence, conflict, and trauma are normalised as everyday happenings, Ali Akbar Mehta's practice performs the task of critical storytelling of historical narratives. Bringing together local and geographically distant perspectives on constructing historical narratives that shape our political landscape, encourages its audience to revise and reconsider what stories we tell and how we share them. It casts the audience, not as a passive spectator, but as a critical witness.

For Cruel Radiance, Mehta shows two separate archival projects that complement and amplify each other:

> ### Purgatory Archive  
>
> 2016-ongoing
>
> ### War List CODEX
>
> 2014-ongoing
