***Curatorial text:***



*"What are the new ways of seeing and experiencing the world being shaped in our name, or that we are shaping for ourselves and others?*

Artistic practice and research today are increasingly enmeshed in systems and ecologies. Collaboration and transdisciplinarity are key themes. What’s more, we now recognise that the major issues the world faces – the issues that really matter – are all systems issues. Systems are reshaping the world order, which today is based on disenfranchisement, necropolitical governments prioritising security and ‘management of risk’ over welfare, socio-political-legal architectures of control, technology-driven speed regimes, and borderization as processes of containment and regulation. 

One system issue is how these techno-political regimes affect the world around us, and how we experience, understand, and learn from it. A micronarrative within the exhibition, a trajectory formed through works by Joss Allen, Sheung Yiu, Adnan Mirza, Bruno Moreschi and Bernado Fontes, seeks to subvert these effects. Together these four works present systems-critical techno-political narratives that foreground questions of histories, memory, home, reality, commodified value, extractivist capitalism, and ‘strategy of domination’, and seek to expand ways of collaborative and transdisciplinarity knowing."
