> "The word collaborate comes from Latin roots. Words beginning with the prefix col- means together, implying doing something together. The root word laborare, also from Latin, gives us many of the English words used to talk about careers and work. In fact, the word labour comes from this root word. Putting the two Latin parts of this word together, the word literally means “to work together”.
>
> Today, Collaboration is at the core of any artistic, curatorial, choreographic, literary, or activist work, fundamentally transforming the ways in which we think of each of these fields of work both individually as well as collectively. This is especially true of the Finish arts and cultural fields, where a collaboration oriented ecology is actively constructed, one that favours community-based and community-led practices over individual or studio-based working methodologies.
>
> And yet, many of us whether separately or collectively, have confided, shared, or spoken out, about the difficult and precarious conditions in which most of us as artists and cultural workers continue to work. Most often our working conditions are exacerbated rather than relieved by the conditions of competition that frame the ecology of our art and cultural fields, whether competitions of resources, attention, spaces to exhibit, or grants. These conditions of competition exist across visual, literary, music and sound, cinematic, conceptual/ contemporary, and other forms of arts, as well as within social, political, and activism based workings; and in many ways ties us together as fellow-competitors, despite our collective wish to work together as friends, collaborators, and like-minded individuals.
>
> These twin conditions of working together, yet pitted against each other as competitors for resources and recognition is a distinct feature of the Finnish Art world and require further discussion."

She received her Bachelors of Fine Arts with Honours in 2012, with a concentration in Painting from the National College of Arts, Pakistan. Zahrah's practice is deeply experimental including scavenged materials from industry, popular culture, and utility incorporating it into her paintings, on-site installations, video art that is mostly a critique on the notions of gender, adaptation and identity, mental health and types of artistic and everyday labour. Zahrah's visual art practice has recently pivoted to encompass hair and makeup artistry that has led me to be an aspiring hair and makeup artist; serving as a method to engage with the concept of maintenance art and labour that makes up infrastructures of care in the society that she inhabits.
