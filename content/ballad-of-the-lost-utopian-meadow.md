['Ballad of the Lost Utopian Meadow'](https://www.thelostutopianmeadow.com/) is an archive of Finnish food. The project extends the metaphorical implications of what a meadow means to Finland within the contexts of ecological conservation, cultural significance, and as a site of contemporary co-existence.

The ballad confronts and provokes a line of questioning about the origins of food cultures, how recipes travel, the violent, even misogynistic nature of our culinary histories constituted by erasures, the ceremonious nature of eating rituals and the sustainability of consumerist food practices.

The hyper-textual, haunting melody introduces non-Finnish audiences to the Finnish kitchen and constructs an archive for local audiences, letting them delve into marginalised culinary histories by mapping the social and political dimensions of food production, distribution, and consumption in Finland, its histories, and cultural significance, as well as its artistic and aesthetic possibilities.

Conceived by Ali Akbar Mehta and Vidha Saumya for ONOMA summer exhibitions 2020 ‘Meadow’, curated by Taru Elfving, the 72 stanzas of the ballad have been transformed into a sound piece with vocals and piano by the amazing #varialambo (Varia Sjöström and Hatz Lambo), sound design by Kaino Wennerstrand, and recorded at the beautiful studios of Artlab Studio by Albert Ihanus.

The project was produced with the support of **[Contemporary Art Archipelago (CAA)](https://contemporaryartarchipelago.org/commission/ballad-of-the-lost-utopian-meadow-a-finnish-food-archive-by-vidha-saumya-ali-akbar-mehta/)** as part of the *Spectres in Change* project, funded by **Kone Foundation**.
