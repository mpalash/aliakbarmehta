This lecture discussion delves into the issues of artisitc work, labour, employbility, and power, as made visible through the lens of Pilvi Takala's work *Close Watch*, exhibited during the 2022 Venice Bienale, and the politicalities and ethical considerations complicit (and missing) in the onceptualisation of such a work.
