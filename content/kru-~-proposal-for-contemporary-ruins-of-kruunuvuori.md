summary: >-
  Contemporary Ruins of Kruunuvuori is a ‘Visual Anthropology Research Project’
  that indexes forgotten public and personal histories related to the
  Kruunuvuori Villas in Helsinki. It aims to interpret layers within history
  that is hidden from formal narratives, and understand how ‘contemporary ruins’
  are conceived and assigned cultural value. By paying attention to the
  marginalization of derelict materiality, the exhibition will be structured
  around the themes of ‘aesthetics of waste and heritage’; ‘materiality of
  memory’; and ‘significance of Things’.

Ruins rarely fit into the imagination of the Contemporary. In our everyday comprehension ruins bring to mind ancient and enchanted monumental structures; an archaeological dream world featuring celebrities such as Machu Picchu, Pompeii and Angkor Wat. Yet never have so many ruins been produced; so many things been victimized and made redundant, so many sites been abandoned. Closed shopping malls, abandoned military sites, industrial wastelands, derelict mining towns, empty apartment houses, withering capitalist and communist monuments. A ghostly world of decaying modern debris mostly left out of academic concerns and conventional histories, ruins still play a marginal role in the political economy of the past and present; instead becoming a play between absence and presence.

The project will be presented as a Transmedia Installation comprising:

a.	Large format photgraphy and photobooks

b.	Objects and ethnographic reconstructions

c.	Short documentary films

d.	Audio narratives and conversations

e.	Heritage walks.



## About Kruunovuori

In the midst of an old forest, next to a pond that could be anywhere in wilderness is the area of Kruunuvuori, which in the etymology of Suomi means ‘The Crown Mountain’. It is about three kilometers from the heart of Helsinki, and plays host to ghost-like old villas hidden amidst its forest – left at the mercy of nature, with only the slow inevitable passing of time as its constant companion.

The Kruunuvuori Villas – one of Helsinki’s most treasured and publicly well-known secrets, may probably not exist for much longer. Of all the villas surviving their various states of ruins, only a few seem to be structurally sound enough to be conserved as Heritage Sites. Despite the presumably indefinite building ban, the demolition of almost all of the villas, through subversive fires and arson, could very well be imminent. The vast majority of villas are dilapidated, collapsed or burned. Last arson was on June 04, 2015; when the red cottage (Lilla Kronberg) turned into heaps of coal. In 2011, Helsinki city Museum was conducting a study of three of the villas for heritage protection, but since then nothing has been heard. One of the potentially to-be-protected villas has been destroyed as a result of arson. The museovirastokin mapping found that two of the Kruunuvuoren villas are still active and urgent measures may still be salvageable, although the refurbishment would probably be too expensive an option.

Spaces are formed by the culture and traditions of the people that inhabit them. Their personal and public histories define the character of the space itself. Spaces are transformative as well as instructive in the manner that spaces are still alive with its own history – equally fixated in its own present and looking towards its own future. A space like Kruunovuori, however, has been stripped of these aspects of its identity – not forcibly, not with violence or rage or through some kind of trauma – but through apathy and indifference. And in this sense, Kruunovuori is a site of ‘Contemporary Ruin’.



## Process

Post our introduction to Kruunuvuori as an urban curiosity, we wanted to understand the history and importance of Kruunuvuori as a historical and cultural marker. We began research by asking local residents, enthusiasts and authorities (such as the Helsinki City Museum and The City planning department), and received several citations and information on the internet as well. Unfortunately, most of this data is complete – all contain gaps in information or in their retelling, accounts that sound partly like urban legends. As part of our initial research, we pieced together a cohesive history of Kruunuvuori. This text forms the foundation of the project.

The project maps Kruunuvuori in the contexts of site, stage and structure. This kind of a mapping enables an introspective enquiry into multiple narratives at play while defining the structure of the research. On one hand the process entails a ‘museumification’ of Kruunuvuori – a process of history viewing that becomes romantic and nostalgic; while on the other hand, preserving memory, important ontological beliefs and natural rights.



a.	Site: a position in context to its environment. An absolute location in terms of its cultural context, historical memory and national identity;

b.	Stage: where site can be looked as transformative spaces of 'performance of the everyday;

c.	Structure: where mode of building, construction; arrangement of parts, elements, or constituents can be looked as key ingredients that make up a space.



Another context of enquiry are the juxtaposition of the villas and the recent re-development of Kruunuvuorenranta, which “will be designed as a high-quality seaside neighborhood \[…] The built environment will be essentially urban with nature and planting brought into it. Down by the shore there will a water bus terminal, a visitors’ marina, and harbors for small boats, jetties for fishing and places for sunbathing \[…] Construction will start around 2010, and the area will be completed by about 2025. Approximately, a little over 10,000 people will be inhabiting this new developed area, increasing the island’s population to 17,500 people.”

While the current Redevelopement plans are being executed all around the island of Kruununvuorenranta, the villas of Kruununvuori remain abandoned in a temporal limbo. No plans have yet been formalised for them, except that they are to remain more or less a ‘Green Area’. The question of how this ‘Green Area’ will be affected by the sudden influx of development and population in the surrounding areas remains to be explored – How will the delicate ecosystem of insects, reptiles, birds and animals transform due to the occupation of heavy civilisation? How will the people inhabiting the surrounding regions react to this space viz. the usage, their own security concerns and the free entry into these spaces? Will these spaces remain as the celebrated spaces of history or eventually be looked as an eyesore in the midst of upcoming development and deterrent to ‘progress’. These are some of the issues that need to be addressed and to understand the nature of this space to enable the Ruins of Kruunuvuori to remain undisturbed.

In the end, the archival project is primarily visual anthropology, in part because it began with casual photography of a ‘tourist’ site; but also because the main element in tying all this information is photgraphic – culminating into an involving photographs, video documentary, site visits, personal narratives and historic fact based research.
