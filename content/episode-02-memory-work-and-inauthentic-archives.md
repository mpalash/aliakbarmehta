**The Archive as Contemporary Object ‘X’** (ArCo-X) is a podcast series project that investigates through discourse, the nature of the archival today, seeking to unpack the several system issues affecting the world around us, through a multifocal lens of archiving as artistic, curatorial, and research praxis. In these critical discussions, the invited speakers – critical thinkers, media theorists, data law and policymakers, social activists, political theorists, art and cultural workers, as well as the moderator/hosts – will examine how data censorship, power/knowledge matrix, and ‘direct, structural, and cultural violence’ affect the way we interface with data and shape our online archives. The project is crucial in consolidating the active and present voices to reveal how ‘queer anti-racist post-internet aesthetics’ may be utilised to create ‘Politically Conscious Archives’ for the future: as open-source, free, online platforms.

**Party Office** is an anti-caste, anti-racist, trans-feminist art and social space. Through conceptual architectures, it builds intersectional dialogues on the commons toward empathetic and critical future publics.
