**Ali and Susanna, tell us about your practice!**

*Susanna:* I have been involved with open cultural heritage over the last decade, advocating releasing cultural heritage artefacts in the open platforms. My curiosity for networked histories, such as is the object of amateur historians’ work, drove me to join the the international community of Wikimedians and OpenGLAM activists in creating the sum of all knowledge. But I was to learn that the scope of those projects would not extend to the more personal and intertwined mesh of great secrets and great passions, of personal and collective histories.

I am motivated by how data can give form to narratives made up of archival materials it is attached to. My work in exploring semantically driven narrative in m-cult in the early 2000’s was a precedent for my current work with the Wikidocumentaries project. I went on to investigating using historical maps in associating pieces of history in the Wikimaps project. Moreover, the OpenGLAM / GLAM-Wiki work has set the stage for a variety of collaborations between memory organisations and volunteers, such as hackathons, contests, software projects and learning events.

After trial and error in my sociocultural explorations of the open knowledge systems, I am determined to hack the system to open the gates for networked, collective remembrance.

*Ali:* For the last 8 years, I have been calling myself a transmedia artist. Part of media theorist Henry Jenkins’ vocabulary, the term transmedia means ‘narrative that extends beyond multiple media forms that also plays to the strength of those forms.’ This could be defined as the driving force of my practice, where each project is defined by the parameters of its subject, its need and its relationship to an audience. I am interested in making archival systems rather than excavating existing archives to re-read them, and as such I am interested in system thinking, data infrastructures, and confronting architectures of control, whether technological or socio-political. A fundamental thread of my practice is linked to investigating forms of violence, conflict, and trauma that surround us daily, and the immersive archives I construct are aimed to counter them, by exploring collective identity and making visible that which has been marginalised and repressed through history. A recent project I completed was 256 Million Colours of Violence, a survey-based archival project that invites participants to co-create an archive of colours that represent ‘violence’. Through 50 questions, participants delve into the normalised, normative, the disproved-yet-in-practice, the banal, obscure, unheard of, and the unthinkable to reveal ‘direct, structural, and cultural’ violence present in everyday life and elicit ‘knowledge systems’ that reproduce and sustain the ecology of violence.

**What is the project Central Park Archives about?**

*Ali & Susanna:* The Central Park Archives is a project where we shall explore practices of collaborative archiving together with residents of Maunula. As a community, neighborhood, suburb, forest, park, site-of-redevelopment, site of disrepute, and/or space-in-flux, Maunula and the adjoining part of the Central Park have several overlapping histories, or micro-histories, each are more under-researched and under-represented than the next.

The participants of the project represent different communities and networks that live this space. Jointly we shall investigate means for storing, rediscovering and exchanging any information along the lifeline of the Central Park that the participants themselves have a connection with.

Our aim is to create the conditions where existing voices in Maunula may be defragmented, or brought together while maintaining the plurality of each voice. In this research of the digital online archiving methods of today, we will address the Commons as a metaphor (the meadow) and a practice (public safeguard). We will examine the axes of privacy/publicity and sustainability/vulnerability related to it. accessibility.

The Wikidocumentaries project attempts to provide a platform where the globally gathered open content of Wikimedia projects as well as any openly licensed materials, can be brought together with the personal recollections for exploration, reuse and enriching. This work will contribute to further development of the platform.

**What kind of collaboration do you envision in the project?**

*Ali & Susanna:* We invite local activists, residents, and communities to cooperate, such as On behalf of Central Park, Streamwater Management Association, Maunula Column Farmers, Maunula Society, Maunula Sanomat. Free-form co-production starts with discussions, walks, and data collection trips and continues with workshops where the joint material is compiled into a live online archive.

Together, we explore the ways provided by a familiar online environment to store and archive the memory we collect. Based on this, we outline new processes that would make the preservation of the materials more secure, better linked to the collections stored by others, and could be produced on the terms of both individuals and different communities.
