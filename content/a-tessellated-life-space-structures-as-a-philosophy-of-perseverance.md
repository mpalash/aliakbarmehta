shortdesc: Rasheed Araeen is best known for his formal, geometric sculptures,
  often created from simple, sometimes industrial materials that renounce
  traditional sculptural hierarchies and compositional concerns. He has been an
  ardent advocate of postcolonial and decolonial positions as put forward in the
  magazine Black Phoenix (co-founded by Araeen in 1978–1979) and later in Third
  Text (founded by Araeen in 1987). As curator of the landmark exhibition “The
  Other Story” (Hayward Gallery, London 1989), Araeen has continually challenged
  knowledge(s) fortified through histories of coloniality and hegemonic
  discourses of Western modernism.
