The making of the rice pudding (_Riisipuuro/Kheer_) is overlapped by the audio of interviews of visitors to the exhibition "Refugee, Evacuee, Migrant" (Finnish National Museum, 2016).

During the interview, members of the audience are asked about their responses to the exhibition, their feelings towards the current refugee crisis, and their own memories of events of migration.
