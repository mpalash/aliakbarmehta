## Arts & Sciences: Telluride 2024

**July 26 – August 2, 2024**

<br/>

In September 1979, twenty invited participants came together for ***[Arts & Sciences: Telluride 1979](http://www.radlab.com/information/artsandsciences.html)***, a weeklong retreat workshop, supported by the National Endowment for the Arts, TCAH and the Zoline Foundation. It resulted in a number of significant interactions and follow-up projects.

Commemorating 45 years since this event, Arts & Sciences is now being organized to once again take place in Telluride, with a special weeklong series of public events, discussions, exhibitions and featured ***[Leonardo LASER](https://leonardo.info/laser-talks)*** Zoom exchanges, from July 26 through August 2, 2024.
