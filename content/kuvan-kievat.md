[Kuvan Kev√§t](https://www.exhibitionlaboratory.fi/exhibition/kuvan-kevaet-2020) is the annual MFA Degree Show of the Academy of Fine Arts, University of the Arts Helsinki. On October 20, 2020, I was invited by Professor Anna-Kaisa Rastenberger to spend time with a selected group of emerging artists from the Academy, speak to them and provide critique and feedback to individual works and the overall exhibition.
