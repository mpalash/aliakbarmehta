The project is displayed in Mumbai for the first time, in 2017.

As a traveling project across venues, the project in its iteration at Mumbai Assembly is conceptualised to be a space for discourse and conversation. This translated as three events, each a dialogue with an invited speaker to collectively reflect on violence in its various forms by forming symbiotic relationships with each other’s praxes.

  **March 17, 2017 | 6:30 – 7:30 pm**

Following a spoken word performance by **Ramneek Singh**, a conversation between Artist Ali Akbar Mehta and Ramneek Singh looks at 'Colour and Violence' through the lens of poetry and the spoken word, attempting to bridge the often unverbalised but deeply personal and unique emotional responses.

  **March 18, 2017 | 6:30 to 8:00 pm**

Ali Akbar Mehta and **Simpreet Singh** discuss how the project is addressing the notion of freely given information, conditional agreements and consent – to corporations and governments, as opposed to an artist project. Simpreet Singh brings his knowledge and experience of having worked with the 'Right to Information Act; (RTI) to similarly pursue and make visible those truths that are important to us.


## _Big Data Ethics_

  **March 19, 2017 | 6:30 to 8:00 pm**

Ali Akbar Mehta in conversation with **Sameer Pitalwala** discuss how most data-mining exercises and empirical scientific surveys require a culled group in order to eradicate diversity, a standardisation of the test group to remove ‘noise’. Instead, a project such as ‘256 Million Colours of Violence’ is a celebration of that noise which represents the diversity of Human experience and collective memetic history. It is also part of an ongoing discourse to reduce effects of stereo-typification through personal scrutiny of the word and meanings of ‘Violence' by asking how is the narrative experience of colour embodied, embedded and extended in the contexts of these meanings.
