"\[...]how to bypass the conditions of competition that are structured around the seemingly independent sea of art and cultural workers? This question is particularly pertinent in the context of Finland, where globally preferred methodologies of a white cube ‘gallery-collector-auction house’ method no longer find their ground, where the apparent focus is placed squarely on artists not having to sell artworks to survive, where instead practitioners may commit to the ‘important, critical, or otherwise exploratory methods’ of art-making, presumably outside the parameters of finance and economies."
