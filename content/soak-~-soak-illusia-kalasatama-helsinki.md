This project and exhibition are born from an urge and necessity to explore and create new narratives that can challenge the way we conceive the *space of art* and *places for culture*.

By exploring the "de-contextualised" we can start formulating critical strategies to create *meeting points (encounters)* between artistic practices outside the white cube and outside the institution.

To occupy spaces that are noted as *strangers*: forgotten, or remembered in a *blur*.

The way that a boat is a *machine for exploration*, our artistic and curatorial practices inside this boat are very much UNCHARTED.

How does art exist in a space that doesn't rely on its permanence? How will the *memory of art* affect this moving machine? Will it affect its route?
