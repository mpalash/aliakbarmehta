  Agonistic Intelligence/s (or another AI/s) is a gathering of invited provocateurs, guest speakers, and participants that convenes as a Summer School for the Helsinki Biennial 2023. This research-led working group engages with a shortlisted selection of the HAM art collection as a key focal node and as an ‘archival site of inquiry’. 


  To help us unpack the multiple overlapping thematics of the Biennial NEW DIRECTIONS MAY EMERGE and the Summer School, guest speakers are invited to engage with the working group and conduct open-to-public lectures. 


  Please join us to welcome **சிந்துஜன் வரதராஜா ​(Sinthujan Varatharajah​)**

> museums across europe are invested in 'diversifying' the demographics of their visitors by employing a variety of crowd-chasing strategies. can the museum be mainstreamed though, so much that it's open and attractive to all? and should it be?
