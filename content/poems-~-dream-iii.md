The sun in the eyes is blinding,

The light, ripping and scorching

Baring the last vestiges of my soul,

Revealing the demons I nurture inside

I gaze at the light unflinchingly

With hope for retribution

Bitter, for I am not ready

I seek the darkness to hide myself

I feel the light betray me

The dark is dimming

Liquid light spills over to the shadows

Light of dawn cracks the sky

Shatters the illusion of night

The comfortable dark

Of womb and void

Is now naked and stark

Bright light of the world

And I find myself,

Alone in the light
