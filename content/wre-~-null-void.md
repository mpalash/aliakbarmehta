summary: The soundscape is dense and layered, blended, and forever thinning and
  thickening. One hears no unison, only a constant figure to ground motion of
  densities, decays and fades, of overlapping, alternating, and interlocking
  sounds... One sound stands out momentarily, then just as quickly fades into a
  distance, overlapped or echoed by a new or repeated emergence in the mosaic.
  The idea is to have the sound raise the question about the relation of voice
  and sound viz. place and non-place, to play with associative memories to
  generate a lucid space between memory and nothingness. And when you hear the
  way birds overlap in the forest and you hear the electromagnetic sounds of
  space, all of a sudden you can grasp something at a sensuous level that is
  considerably more abstract and difficult to convey.
