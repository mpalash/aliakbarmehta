  > Narrating WAR is an invitation to imagine a relationship between the ‘known’ and the ‘unknown’ of our collective human history. It is an ongoing series of performance readings of a comprehensive list of ‘wars, battles, sacks, sieges, revolts, revolutions, bombings and insurgencies – from 3000 BC to the present’ that provides a comprehensive tableau of a history of human beings as a continuous history of violence and conflict.

This, the tenth iteration of **Narrating WAR** in the ongoing series of performances, is devised and re-imagined together with Helsinki based duo ***[varialambo](https://varialambo.com/)*** (Varia Sjöström and Hatz Lambo), the performance is an exploration of *how to read a list of conflicts?*  

And so this performance is a reading of remembrance, of mourning, of not forgetting, of saying that *the war that is coming is not the last one*, or even that *the war can be over if you want it*. As such, it is a poetic encounter – where only the name of the conflict, it's date(s) of occcurence, and the parties involved are read out – without explanations, backstories, aftermath or judgement. Yet, to be immersed in the historical presence of war can be a powerful poetic encounter.\
\
This spatially and temporally scalable performance is extended or reduced in accordance with differently available conditions, and at the **[New Performance Turku, Festival 2020: Mobilities](http://newperformance.fi/ali-akbar-mehta/?lang=en)**, a four-hour performance is conducted where contemporary conflicts from the year 2000 to the present are read.

The complete performance duration of **Narrating WAR** is over 12 days, and the 4-hour iteration in Turku, performed in collaboration with *varialambo,* focuses on conflicts from the year 2000 to the present.
