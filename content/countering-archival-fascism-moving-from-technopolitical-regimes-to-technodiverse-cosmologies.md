Countering Archival Fascism, a talk conducted in the inaugural seminar of **deCYPher** discusses the colonial histories/historical roots of archives, present not only in traditional archives, contemporary digital archives, new modes of archival knowledge production, but also in big data, academic and research-oriented datasets, and source material for AI/ML platforms today. In doing this, I want to outline a few key ethico-onto-epistemic positions from which to move forward.
