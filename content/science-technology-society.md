summary: >-
  *science_technology_society* seeks to support contemporary interdisciplinary
  approaches that consider, intervene in, and speculate on the world in which we
  live and its possible futures.


  The third season of *science_technology_society* explores how emergent technologies complicate our understanding of mental well-being. The season probes the potential for intersecting art, science, and technology to reimagine mental health support, justice, and pride.

We live in a time in which mental suffering appears to be both increasingly profound and ever-proliferating. It is common to hear arguments about how the development of digital technologies has exacerbated our mental health crisis — as they drastically shape our sense of self, social relationships, as well as living and labouring conditions. However, those same technological advances are often held up as offering solutions, including opening up new possibilities of forging connections, building support systems, and addressing marginalised needs.

Against this fast-evolving socio-political, technological, and discursive backdrop, the winter 2025 residency season at Delfina Foundation invites practitioners to depart from the following questions: how could we re-examine the conceptualisation of ‘mental health’ today? What new mental landscapes could we envision? What forms of radical Mad knowledge and structures of care could we produce?
