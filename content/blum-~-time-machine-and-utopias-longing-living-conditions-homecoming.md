The exhibition at Gallen-Kallela museum focuses on travel and transport. The artist Akseli Gallen-Kallela’s (1865–1931) travels across oceans and to virgin forests open new perspectives on the reasons for travel and wanderlust. The exhibition transports the audience from Tyrvää in the 1880s to New Mexico in the 1920s with a visit in Old Rauma and snow-covered Konginkangas. 

Exhibition invites us to reflect upon our relationship with travelling, mobility, and the experiences it affords us. The exploration is brought to life through contemporary art and soundscapes.
