**ARTIVAL Talks** are part of **ARTIVAL RE:CONNECT**, a Nordic multilingual cultural festival held across the Nordic region in 2023. The festival brings a widely diverse array of actors together in a sustainable manner to co-create and reflect on issues of inclusion and belonging with exhibitions, performances, talks, workshops, recitals, and more, at a time when many of us around the globe are striving to reconnect, to ourselves, our families, and our communities in one way or another.

ARTIVAL Talks are a collection of live-streamed and virtual discussions, debates and conversations on the themes of ARTIVAL â€“ a festival that places artists, the artistic process and advocacy at the centre. The central aim of the Talks, which began in May 2023, is to facilitate gaining a clearer understanding of different processes, perspectives and viewpoints that exist in Nordic artscapes, by bringing artists, cultural workers, activists, human rights experts, public officials and civil society together to exchange ideas and share experiences of their successes (and failures), good (and bad) practices, and the opportunities (and challenges) present in the broad landscape of the Nordic arts and cultural sector.
