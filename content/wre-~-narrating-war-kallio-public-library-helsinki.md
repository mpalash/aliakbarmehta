A 3 minute excerpt of my radio performance, which was a one hour Performance Reading of Wars from 2000 to 2011, at Kallio Public Library as part of Chimurenga’s Pan African Space Station live radio broadcast.

Originally titled _null.void; // a sermon of nothingness and a space odyssey of zero movement and tycho magnetic anomalies_, **Narrating War** is a Transmedia Performance-lecture recitation and Research Project. It comprises a procedural audio soundscape of glitch sounds using static and radio frequencies, and a performance recitation of a comprehensive list of every _war, battle, siege, sacking, revolt and revolution, bombing and insurgency_ spanning 5014 years of human conflict and violence.
