Moscow-based ***Partizaning Collective*** is an urban activist movement focusing on art as a tool for social change. Two collective members, *Anton Polskiy* and *Natalia Sinitsina* were hosted by m-cult to create "Partizaning Maunula", an intervention focusing on mechanisms of exclusion in the neighbourhood.

In collaboration with artists from Aalto Universityâ€™s *Visual Culture and Contemporary Art* (ViCCA) program, Partizaning created a series of interventions to address the parallel dynamics of gentrification and segregation in the Maunula neighbourhood.
