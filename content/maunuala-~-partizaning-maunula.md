Moscow-based _**Partizaning Collective**_ is an urban activist movement focusing on art as a tool for social change. Two collective members, _Anton Polskiy_ and _Natalia Sinitsina_ were hosted by m-cult to create "Partizaning Maunula", an intervention focusing on mechanisms of exclusion in the neighbourhood.

In collaboration with artists from Aalto Universityâ€™s _Visual Culture and Contemporary Art_ (ViCCA) program, Partizaning created a series of interventions to address the parallel dynamics of gentrification and segregation in the Maunula neighbourhood.
