In 2022, I was invited to be a part of the co-curatorial team of the Helsinki Biennali, 2023 by its head curator [Joasia Krysia](https://helsinkibiennaali.fi/en/hb23/). 

This team, dubbed Co-curatorial Intelligences by Joasia, comprised Ali Akbar Mehta and Giovanna Esposito Youssif from **[Museum of Impossible Forms (MIF)](https://www.museumofimpossibleforms.org/)**, Markus Reymann from **[TBA21–Academy](https://www.tba21.org/#item--academy--1819)**, Jussi Parikka, May Ee Wong and Paolo Patelli from **Critical Environmental Data**, Bassam El Baroni and Patrizia Constantin from **[ViCCA @ Aalto ARTS – Visual Cultures, Curating and Contemporary Art (ViCCA)](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-art/visual-cultures-curating-and-contemporary-art-vicca)**, and **AI Entity** created by artist **[Yehwan Song](https://helsinkibiennaali.fi/en/artist/yehwan-song/)** and the **[Digital Visual Studies project](https://dvstudies.net/)**.

As part of the Museum of Impossible Forms (MIF) curatorial collaboration, we  developed the artist list for the Helsinki Biennali, with special emphasis on artists in Finland who despite a strong practice remain otherwise ignored within the institutional frameworks of Finnish Art and Culture. Through summer 22 to the spring 23, we worked with curatorial team and the artists to facilitate existing and new comissions for the Biennali located on the island of Vallisaari, Helsinki Art Museum (HAM), public locations across the city and the city cultural centers (STOA and Caisa).

Apart from this contribution to the Biennali, Museum of Impossible Forms developed two trajectories of enquiry for the Biennale, a public facing series of events titled **Polyphonic Entanglements** (curated by Giovanna Esposito Youssif) and an institution facing Summer School titled **[Agonsitic Intelligence/s (or another AI/s)](https://helsinkibiennaali.fi/en/event/agonistic-intelligence-s-summer-school/)** (curated by Ali Akbar Mehta).
