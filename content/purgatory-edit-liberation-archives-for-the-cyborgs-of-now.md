***purgatory* EDIT** is conducted daily as participant-driven cyber performances. 

Performance sessions are available as 45, 60, or 75-minute slots (including a 15-minute setup time). Individual performance duration is decided by participants’ choice to participate and time slots are indicative as outer limits.

Performances are designed as 1:1 interactions with the installation, which include wearing EEG headgear and XR glasses. Participation requires signup to create a secure space for your personalised recording, and pre-registration on the purgatory EDIT website (linked below).

Video screenings of previous performance recordings will be on view during non-performance periods. The space accommodates 30-40 members of the audience at a time. Non-participating audiences require no prior registration.
