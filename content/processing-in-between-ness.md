summary: "'\\[...] this publication, as a collaborative endeavor between the
  curators Marianne Savallampi and Ali Akbar Mehta and the artists-in-residence,
  is a culmination of an ‘in-between’ time. It documents this time
  conversations, discussions, email-chains, and chats, collaborative
  explorations, and confessions – that aim to act as a guide to the methods of
  working adopted by these artists/ duos/ collectives. For us, it maps a brief
  moment of time, of histories and memories. For the artists, it is
  simultaneously a space to reveal and share the processes that go into the
  making of these varied multi-layered practices, and possibly a speculative
  imaginary of what lies beyond their own horizons.'"
