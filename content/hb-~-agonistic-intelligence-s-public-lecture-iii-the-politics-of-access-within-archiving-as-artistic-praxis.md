  Agonistic Intelligence/s (or another AI/s) is a gathering of invited provocateurs, guest speakers, and participants that convenes as a Summer School for the Helsinki Biennial 2023. This research-led working group engages with a shortlisted selection of the HAM art collection as a key focal node and as an ‘archival site of inquiry’. 


  To help us unpack the multiple overlapping thematics of the Biennial NEW DIRECTIONS MAY EMERGE and the Summer School, guest speakers are invited to engage with the working group and conduct open-to-public lectures. 


  Please join us to welcome **Annet Dekker**

## Annet Dekker: The Politics of Access within Archiving as Artistic Praxis

**Thursday 17.8.2023** 

**HAM hall, HAM Helsinki Art Museum. Eteläinen rautatiekatu 8.**

Doors open: 17:45

Lecture and Q&A: 18:00 to 19:30

<br/>

> How does an archive live up to its own values and aims in regard to collecting and collection management, especially in relation to access? The digitization of archives and the massive use of the Internet have potentially increased access to the archive and its contents, as well as facilitated the usage of information in the archive.
>
> However, creating access doesn’t necessarily mean that records become accessible. The tension between access and accessibility will be addressed by taking up three challenges that archival organisations are confronted with, but which often remain implicit: (1) standardization as a pre-condition for understandable exchange of information; (2) contextualization as a way to make sense of data; (3) collaboration as a means to involve users.
>
> Rather than focusing on the challenges within archival institutions, and in an attempt to appreciate the tension, in her presentation Annet Decker will focus on archival alternatives that may lead to surprising or new insights when considering what it means to provide access.
