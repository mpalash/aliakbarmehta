summary: >-
  **The Pudding Manifesto for Togetherness** (2016) is a collaborative
  performance installation in which is embedded a _manifesto_ that presents in
  satirical humour the benefits of consuming a 'magical pudding' that will
  change people, a _pledge signing_ and a subsequent _serving of Rice pudding_.
  Rice pudding has a history spanning several civilisations and culture, and
  here we are creating a hybrid pudding based on Syrian and Finnish recipes, as
  a conjoining of two ways of eating and therefore a symbolic act of consumption
  becomes an innovative catalyst for the otherwise rhetorical discourse on
  refugee integration and assimilation into the homogeneous social soup.


  Food has always operated in circulation between the local and the global,
  migration and resettlement and, with its power in defining and performing
  social meanings, served to construct notions of home and cultural otherness.
  Perhaps it can also create notions of togetherness. **We don’t need politics
  of unification – we need politics of togetherness.**
