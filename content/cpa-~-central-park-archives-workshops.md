  The *Central Park Archives* project organised two workshops, on **19.08.2020** and **01.09.2020** to introduce *open source*, and *open content* tools and practices for collaborative online publishing. Why and how to contribute to Wikipedia, Wikidata, OpenStreetMap, and other open projects, and how to use Creative Commons licenses to grant permission to share?


  Using topics and materials from **Central Park Archives** as case examples in the workshop, participants learned to create new Wikipedia articles on related places, organisations, and natural phenomena. Both sessions ended with a short 'clinic' for the *Central Park Archives*, where participants were able to book private sessions with project team members for sharing their own collection with the archive. Participants are asked to bring their materials with them, for example on a memory stick or hard drive.
