Fakhruddin and Khateeja Merchant are both residents of Mazgaon. They are also my grandparents and the primary reason for initiating this project. They both narrate an account of their lives, their childhood, schooling, the socio-political situation of growing up in pre-independance India, the economic struggles of raising a family, and Mazgaon as the anchor of their lives since the last 40 years.
