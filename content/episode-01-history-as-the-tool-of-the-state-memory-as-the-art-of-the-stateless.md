  > “I or people like me, we're not the subject of that history. We are objects of that history. We are not the ones doing things, we're not really actors in that history. This history is just things that happened to us. So that's when I was searching for something else, I think for another space in which to think about the past, think about the experiences, think about previous events, but not through that gaze, not through that thing which in itself has the idea of othering and which in itself has the idea of us and them. And in order to find that space that's when I found the space of memory. Of course, the space of memory is something that has been worked with for eternity. It's a very big concept in a lot of communities that haven't been in the ones that have power or aren't the rulers of history or rulers of how history is written. You can find traces of that all the way from the black experience in the United States to the Jewish diaspora experience, to today the Palestinian experience, to the indigenous struggle. They all are spaces that work with memory and memories are what have saved them. Memories are what has given them this moment of reflection and this moment of connection because they are ruled by histories that don't really treat them like subjects, but rather objects.”


  In this inaugural episode of The Archive as Contemporary Object 'X', we speak with artist, curator and storyteller Farbod Fakharzadeh as he talks about his practice, new projects, the politically charged relationship between history and Memory, and his own situated relationship to them.

**The Archive as Contemporary Object ‘X’** (ArCo-X) is a podcast series project that investigates through discourse, the nature of the archival today, seeking to unpack the several system issues affecting the world around us, through a multifocal lens of archiving as artistic, curatorial, and research praxis. In these critical discussions, the invited speakers – critical thinkers, media theorists, data law and policymakers, social activists, political theorists, art and cultural workers, as well as the moderator/hosts – will examine how data censorship, power/knowledge matrix, and ‘direct, structural, and cultural violence’ affect the way we interface with data and shape our online archives. The project is crucial in consolidating the active and present voices to reveal how ‘queer anti-racist post-internet aesthetics’ may be utilised to create ‘Politically Conscious Archives’ for the future: as open-source, free, online platforms.

**Party Office** is an anti-caste, anti-racist, trans-feminist art and social space. Through conceptual architectures, it builds intersectional dialogues on the commons toward empathetic and critical future publics.
