A unique urban forest, Helsinki’s Central Park, was established and developed as a public park since 1911. The 10-kilometer long park extends from the city centre at Töölönlahti Bay up to the city’s Northern border, crossing dozens of Helsinki districts. The Central Park has a significant value for Helsinkians, who engage with it by daily walks, nature observation, gardening and recreation activities.

In Maunula, the park includes several natural ecosystems - spruce and pine forests, a hazel grove, meadows, an allotment garden, and a stream that encircles the Maunula area. While citizens have fervently maintained its sanctity as a resource as well as preserved its histories, they now defend the park against bureaucratic machinery – city plans that threaten the park’s ecology by new housing blocks and urban boulevard developments.

The *Central Park Archives* project connects a multiplicity of lived experiences, micro-histories, and struggles, documenting the ongoing change and future visions of the park. The objective is to create a commons of shared archives and a set of sustainable archiving practices around the central park, in close cooperation with local individuals and communities. It is conceptually based on a federation of grassroot sub-archives and online culture resources, networked via open data infrastructures.

The project proceeds from on-site research and engaging contributors/collaborators to creating a common/shared interface of access to co-curated archives/materials. The process includes discussions, field trips , and peer-learning workshops on co-archiving as well as working with wikidata and open-source content licenses.

*Central Park Archives* is presented in context of Frame Contemporary Art Finland’s [Rehearsing Hospitalities](https://frame-finland.fi/en/ohjelma/rehearsing-hospitalities/) programme in September 2020. Co-curated by Frame, [m-cult](https://www.m-cult.org/index.php/), and [Museum of Impossible Forms](https://museumofimpossibleforms.org/), the programme focuses on facilitating plural and decentralised forms of knowing and accessibility.

The project is produced in the context of Maunula collaborations programme initiated in 2016.
