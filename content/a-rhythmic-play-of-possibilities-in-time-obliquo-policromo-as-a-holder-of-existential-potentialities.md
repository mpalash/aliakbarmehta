shortdesc: Giorgio Griffa’s practice is one where what he may have to say is
  less important than what you and I, as viewers, may have to imagine. Griffa
  stated this unequivocally when he said in 1972, “I don’t represent anything, I
  paint”. His work has always sought to move beyond the prescriptive ordering of
  surface, intuitive marks, and exuberant colours, instead pushing to question
  the medium’s relationship with knowledge. Inherent in Griffa’s practice is a
  proposal that what a painting ‘is’ is not nearly close to what a painting
  ‘could be’  – a holder of existential potentialities, an engine of
  possibilities driven by its audience.
