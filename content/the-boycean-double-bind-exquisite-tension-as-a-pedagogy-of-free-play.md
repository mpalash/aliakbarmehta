shortdesc: At first glance, Exquisite Tension (2005) may look like one of
  Boyce’s most unassuming works. When viewing the 4-minute video work for the
  first time, one is confronted by an apparently casual rendition of a simple
  ritualised action, yet set in a scene with a combination of actions unfamiliar
  to us as an everyday experience. In it, the hands of the artist plait the hair
  of performance artist Guillermo Gómez-Peña and curator Adelaide Bannerman,
  friends to Boyce but perhaps strangers to each other, where the latter is
  invited to be a stand-in for the artist during the recording of the work.
