In this online and open-access database, each tablet represents a conflict entry, where dots on it mark the number of belligerents or sides that were active in the conflict. For example, conflicts may have two sides, A against B, but also up to 5 sides have been documented in certain conflicts. 

The left panel displays the timeline from 3500 BC to the present. Conflicts are no longer fragmented in normalised methods of separation by time periods, countries, nation-states, or geo-political locations, but instead are listed in a singular time-flow of human history.

The right panel displays a typology of conflict, along with a search interface to explore the conflicts. Each conflict may be categorised and colour-coded into 1 or more of 10 main categories: Theatre, War, Battle, Genocide, Sack and Siege, Revolts and Revolutions, Insurgency, Bombing, Campaign, and Occupation. It is further subdivided into 37 different types of conflict.

The entire database is cross-referenced, tabulated, and searchable via
