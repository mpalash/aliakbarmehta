The project was originally inspired by Jacques Rivette’s Out 1: Noli Me Tangere (1971), a 13 hour film (behemoth in its time) made up of absurd and fragmented scenes. These come together to form an image of Paris in the early 70s that has been described as both dreamlike and nightmarish.

Instead of adapting or reenacting the film, Out 2 generates a view of possible correspondences surrounding the question “where are we now?”. For OUT 2 this means the unravelling of individual authorship in favour of a collective one. In taking this gamble, the only parameters we have upheld are against creating parameters, including a resistance towards establishing a definitive end. And so OUT 2 unfolds as a self-generating creature, gradually developing into its own master.
