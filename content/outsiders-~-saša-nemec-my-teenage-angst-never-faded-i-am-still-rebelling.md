**Saša Nemec** is an independent artist working between Nova Gorica, Slovenia and Helsinki, Finland. Her practice spans between exploration of new technologies and use of age-old techniques – from mending a loose button to creating garments with 3D scanning technology. Since 2017 she has been a part of ‘Collective Intelligence’ with whom she presented projects in Helsinki and Palermo. Their latest project ‘Il Traffico’ was part of ‘Manifesta12 5x5x5 program’. She has continued to organise Repair-a-thons in Finland since 2016, firstly in the scope of Fashion Revolution Finland, then independently. She has collaborated with Designmuseo, Aalto University, Upcycling Design Center and Fashion Colloquium. **OUTSIDERS AT WORK** met Saša Nemec after the successful completion ‘Pixelache Festival 2019 – Breaking the Fifth Wall’ of which she was one of the artistic directors, to talk about the politics of textiles, Pixelache Festival and repairing for sustainable futures.
