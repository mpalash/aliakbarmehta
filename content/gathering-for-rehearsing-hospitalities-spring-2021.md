Gathering for Rehearsing Hospitalities Spring 2021 is an online and onsite programme that runs from mid-April until the end of May with the aim to connect artists, curators and other practitioners within the field of contemporary art, and beyond. The programme experiments with formats for gathering and hosts opportunities to engage in person or remotely. 

During 2020-21 the Rehearsing Hospitalities programme has centred on addressing art and institutional potential to facilitate plural and decentralised forms of knowing and access. In collaboration with a number of partners and contributors, it has looked into how dominant and institutionalised knowledges and forms of access can be challenged from a range of perspectives. A guiding question of the programme has been: how can diverse access to language, environment, culture and archives produce more equal and just contemporary societies? 

Gathering for Rehearsing Hospitalities Spring 2021 brings together various contributors engaged in this ongoing dialogue for a series of events that platform their work and open up further dialogues in public. The programme invites guests and audiences to rehearse and debate hospitality towards diverse ways of knowing and matters of access. 

The Gathering hosts three online afternoon conversation events, two online artworks (a video work and an audio work), two installations in venues in Helsinki, an online film premiere and the launch of a publication project presenting a collection of access riders. There will also be a series of informal online get-togethers with international curators. Accompanying the Gathering is the publication Rehearsing Hospitalities Companion 2. Published and framed as a place to gather in September 2020, it hosts a range of guests and contributions which connect to the public events programme this spring.
