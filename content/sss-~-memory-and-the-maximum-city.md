_"In this talk held at the Godrej India Culture Lab on 9th January 2015, Anusha Yadav (founder of the Indian Memory Project) and Dr. Indira Chowdhury (President of the International Oral History Association) took the audience on a nostalgic journey of the city's past using sound, photographs and much more. Artist Ali Akbar Mehta who displayed his exhibit titled 'Site: Stage: Structure' at the event was also part of the Q&A that took place after the presentations."_

Memory and Maximum City was one of my first talks as an artist. Here I
presented some of the work shown during SITE : STAGE : STRUCTURE, a transmedia
archival installation of my four year engagement with Mazgaon and its several
microcommunities. At this talk I spoke about the process of how my journey
with this project began and in the subsequent conversation with members of the
audience and fellow speakers, discussed the importance of alternative methods
of history-building and the importance of oral histories.
