_Narrating War_ at The Clark House Artist Collective, is a 3 day performance
reading of select excerpts from the 'War list codex', on March 21 - 23, 2017,
from 11 am to 5 pm.

See the complete performance [here](https://www.facebook.com/clarkhouseinitiative/videos/1265650923482416/)

Previously, the performance has been executed in two spaces as part of projects/exhibitions in Helsinki and Tampere. The performances are part of an ongoing project 'WAR • ROOM • ECHO: Regarding the Pain of Other Cyborgs', and is imagined to be a endurance performance over several hours, sometimes days – where the act of reading, almost like a litany, the list of Every War, Battle, Sack, Siege, Revolt and Revolution from 3000BC to the present, creating a tableaux of a 5017 year history of human conflict – becomes simultaneously an act of mourning, remembrance and a call for action, towards change.
