"Transmedia artist Ali Akbar Mehta’s journey has been one of continuous learning and unlearning. There are several roles he performs as artist, curator and researcher to focus on alternative, innovative and inclusive discourses.

In a conversation with Art Fervour, he explores ‘archiving’ and the ways it translates as an artistic practice, poetics and performance."
