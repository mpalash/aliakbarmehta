  Essay written in collaboration with Marianne Savallampi, for [Racism, Power and Resistance](https://www.gaudeamus.fi/rasismivaltajavastarinta/ "Permalink to Suvi Keskinen, Minna Seikkula & Faith Mkwesha (eds.): Racism, Power and Resistance (4/2021)") (in Finnish)


  > Everyday racism is often subtle and not appalling. Many don’t even understand their behavior as racist.

  >

  > Racism permeates Finnish society as an everyday and experiential phenomenon, but it is also an institutional and structural problem. The Black Lives Matter movement has also sparked a debate here and shown that many people need information that is specifically adapted to the Finnish environment and based on research. Who can or must talk about racism?

  >

  > *Racism, power and resistance* present racism and colonialism in Finnish society and their global connections. Everyday examples of high school TET training for policing are eye-opening. The work questions the racist definitions of Finnishness and the unhistorical understanding of racism, and makes anti-racism visible. The work gives voice to racist researchers and civic activists and provides tools for anti-racist action.
