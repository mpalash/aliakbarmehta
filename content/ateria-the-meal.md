Project in collaboration with Kiasma Theatre and students of Visual Culture and Contemporary Art (ViCCA), Aalto University, Helsinki.

The exhibition was envisaged as a three day project at [Kiasma Museum of Contemporary Art](https://kiasma.fi/en/), Helsinki, that stemmed from the continued practice of cooking within the University campus, cementing the kitchen as the central node in pedagogy, community building and the continued engagements forming friendships and peerhood.

"**The Meal** is a series of art works including community meals. A three day event of food and art, comprising of gatherings, conversations, interventions, participatory actions and performances, and of course, food. It is an act of coming together, meeting new people, cooking, eating and building a community. It is about having conversations leading to deeper knowledge of the world around us, and allowing an extensive exploration of each others’ cultures, personalities and worldviews. _The Meal is free and open to all._

The Meal will be happening on the lawn and theatre space of Kiasma and is hosted by MA students of Aalto University’s ViCCA (Visual Culture and Contemporary Art) program in collaboration with Kiasma Museum and URB 2017."
