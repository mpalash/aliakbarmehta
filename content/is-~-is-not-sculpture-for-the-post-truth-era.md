It is said that we have moved into a “post-truth” era, as scientific fact has made way for opinion and belief. Are we humans returning to a pre-enlightenment society ruled by priests and monarchs, where the masses are kept ignorant of facts, and ruling elites use fear to keep in power? Can science and reason prevail in this new/old world, or will we enter a new dark ages?

The exhibition is open in the Learning Centre Lobby on 14-25.2.2017.
