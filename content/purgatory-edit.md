  **Purgatory Edit** (working title) is an experimental cinematic experience
  based on the conceptualizations of the Yugoslavian ‘Black Wave’ Cinema
  movement, “standing for the subordination of form to the psychological
  contents of human ethical and metaphysical drama today”; and on Artaud’s
  ‘Theatre of Cruelty’ as “a means by which artists assault the senses of the
  audience”. It uses ‘algorithmic code-based editing’ to parallel and depart
  from the “Soviet Montage Movement”, by using machine coding to simulate the
  intellectual montage, metric, rhythmic, tonal, and over-tonal editing that are
  the characteristics of the movement, to create concepts and ideas.

Conceived of as an interactive audiovisual performance installation, in collaboration with artist Jernej Čuček Gerbec (SL), it is inspired by the Ludovico Technique, a fictional negative-aversion technique depicted in ‘A Clockwork Orange’ (1971) directed by Stanley Kubrick, based on Anthony Burgess's novel: 

> In the film, a Dr. Brodsky (Carl Duering) of the Ludovico medical facility forces Alex (Malcolm McDowell) to watch violent images for extended periods of time as his eyes are held open with specula. He's pumped with nausea-, paralysis- and fear-inducing drugs at the same time, with the objective being the development of a nauseous association when experiencing or thinking about violence, causing an aversion. It's essentially a mechanical, Pavlovian construct that associates stimuli with negative reinforcement instead of positive.

**Purgatory Edit** mimics the Ludovico Technique (although without pumping participants with nausea-, paralysis- and fear-inducing drugs) to scrutinise the boundaries between aversion and enforcement, proclivity and phobia. It parallels the dystopian narrative of A Clockwork Orange to explore the value of worldviews concocted through prosaic binaries such as ‘Good and Evil’, or ‘War and Peace’ and whether these meta-concepts make sense in the hyper-nuanced complexities of our world today. It examines the power of hegemonic representation within historical, visual, and cinematic vocabularies – through numerous video clips ranging from archival war footage, film clips, documentary footage, advertisements, news clips, landscape panoramas, and home videos. Using these videos, two sets of video bins or databanks are created, one labeled ‘War’, and the other ‘Peace’. 

The project casts the participant as a critical spectator and a witness – not to the macro tides of history, but to the fate of those invisibilised and marginalised within these histories of power relations. “\[T]he humanism of the Black Wave films can be located in their siding with the downtrodden. These marginal figures were often wanderers and drifters shuttling between spaces in an existence lacking stability. Constantly in transition, they were restless travelers in their own country.”
