The **Cyber Performance** invites the audience as participants to investigate the archive using their own emotional, neural, and cognitive agency via a portable EEG ‘brainware’, a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), and through software developed by the purgatory EDIT team. The participant’s brainwaves are translated to ‘emotion-based metrics’ that control real-time sequencing, juxtaposition, and playback of individual clips in the Archive – generating unique conceptual montages that reveal individual participant’s relationship to cinematic vocabularies of violence.

***purgatory* EDIT** is prophetic of a world, hurtling towards a cataclysmic end while simultaneously potent with utopian promise. Through the **Doomscroll Archive**, historic and immediate pasts shape speculative futures, creating data worlds that mirror and shadow our physical, experiential world. These data worlds transcend borders while we witness struggles over openness and enclosure, sovereignty and nationalism, citizenship and identity, security and freedom.
