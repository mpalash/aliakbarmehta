summary: >-
  Purgatory EDIT is a user-generated montage-based cinematic experience. Based
  on the principles of the Yugoslavian ‘Black Wave Cinema’ movement, “standing
  for the subordination of form to the psychological contents of human ethical
  and metaphysical drama today”; and on Artaud’s ‘Theatre of Cruelty’ as “a
  means by which artists assault the senses of the audience”, it highlights the
  methods through which digital technologies affect subliminal visual
  manipulation, sensory overload, data fatigue, psychological reaction, and
  ideological numbness.


  Purgatory EDIT, as an interactive audiovisual performance installation, is inspired by the Ludovico Technique, a fictional negative-aversion technique depicted in ‘A Clockwork Orange’ (1971) directed by Stanley Kubrick, based on Anthony Burgess’s novel: 


  > In the film, Dr Brodsky (Carl Duering) of the Ludovico medical facility forces Alex (Malcolm McDowell) to watch violent images for extended periods of time as his eyes are held open with specula, while being pumped with nausea-, paralysis- and fear-inducing drugs at the same time. Its objective: the development of a nauseous association when experiencing or thinking about violence, causing an aversion.

As a speculative installation, Purgatory EDIT mimics the Ludovico Technique (although without pumping participants with nausea-, paralysis- and fear-inducing drugs) that parallels the dystopian narrative of A Clockwork Orange, to scrutinise the boundaries between aversion and enforcement, proclivity and phobia. It explores the value of worldviews concocted through prosaic binaries such as ‘Good and Evil’, or ‘War and Peace’ and whether these meta-concepts make sense in the hyper-nuanced complexities of our world today.
