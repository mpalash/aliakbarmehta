The Kingdom of Cards depicted here is a reality embodied in today’s world. The intertwined strands of the orthodox and the liberal, and our society’s continuing failure to separate the two have created a dual discourse – a conflict between the real and fictional – the visible and invisible – the actual and the aspirational.
