In October 2020 I was invited by curator and course leader Marialaura Ghidini, to speak to the MFA students of Srishti School of Art, Design, and Technology (Bengaluru) within the context of curating and archiving.

During this session conducted online, I discussed various artistic and curatorial strategies, shared excerpts of my own archival praxis, as well as discussed and gave critical feedback to the students' own projects. 

This process culminated in the development of a series of online archives within the students' own research interests, and was exhibited as an online exhibition, called **[DATALANDS](https://datalandscreativea.wixsite.com/datalands).**
