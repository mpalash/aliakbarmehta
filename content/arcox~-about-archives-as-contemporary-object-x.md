  ArCo-X


  As a project, ArCo-X is based on the premise forwarded by Anne-Françoise Schmid, who claims that “today we are faced with objects that are, at once, acts of aggression and choreographed performances and technological simulations and training exercises. We have to find a new way to describe such objects; in a certain sense, they exist in a properly interdisciplinary or non-disciplinary place, a place described by the points at which they become unknown to each discipline. (schmid: 2021)

  The Archive is such an object, that as a field of study can no longer neatly fit within its own domain. Despite a division into various sub-disciplines, there still exist too many gaps through which a comprehensive and contemporary understanding of archives elude us.

A critical starting point for mapping this new ecology of data archives lies in recognising and addressing the key issues of our age, where we are living in the age of rising ethnofascism and disintegrating democracies, where conflicts, pandemics, human crises have become just another tool for capitalist societies to recycle pain. There is increasing information overload; online interfaces for knowledge are steadily becoming opaque; and the data we produce serves the capitalist pursuits of Surveillance Empires, corporations and necropolitical governments. By declaring ownership of their users’ data, and engaging in behavioural manipulations for data extractivism, Surveillance Empires have forced the creation of new categories to explain the production and accumulation of ‘value’ in capitalism: such as *Attention Economy* (Davenport & Beck: 2001; Celis Bueno: 2017); *Surveillance Capitalism* (Zuboff: 2019), and *Computational Capitalism* (Beller: 2018). This, in turn, reshapes political world orders based on disenfranchisement, creating necropolitical governments of management, techno-legal architectures of control, and legalised policing of ‘Direct, Structural, and Cultural Violence’ – the age of ‘Planetary Entanglement’ (Mbembe: 2021).

Archives, fortified through multiple performativities, as ‘politics of knowledge’; ‘knowledge economies’; and ‘power-knowledge relations’; become a ‘productive force’ for biopolitical apparatus (Agamben: 2009). Such apparatus, as a Foucauldian machinery of governance, is not fixated on security or welfare but on the premise of dispensability (Mbembe: 2019). The project seeks to centralise the ‘dispensable bodies, objects, data, and networks’ as key subjects, to reveal dominant narratives and the structural management of violence through their interactions with systemic conditions like globalisation, financialisation, socio-political issues of gender, class, race, caste, class, as histories of oppression.

Yet, an online user’s participation can cultivate or disrupt the commodification of data on the Net. Archives, especially those created online, have the potential to counter traditional understandings of power. ArCO-X, as interdisciplinary conversations will provide a techno-political map for creating politically conscious archives: archives that articulate the current paradigm shift in our understanding of the political, and that as witnesses, embody the responsibility of giving testimony to histories or truths of occurrences, seeking to re-imagine the ‘archives’ as spaces for confrontation and dissonance, fundamentally altering the capacity of us as users “to be active participants in the public sphere as opposed to its passive readers, listeners, or viewers”. It is positioned as an appeal for archives as being not burdened only with the past and the idea of memory, but as containers of imagination – through which we may envision politically conscious futures.
