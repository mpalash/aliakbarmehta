**The dust that has settled still hurtles through space** is a 2-hour multimedia work. It comprises an audio score built around processed moving images dealing with the representation of violence: a compilation of various scenes of conflict, media clips of protest, archival footage of war, nuclear blasts, and ecological disasters such as volcano eruptions and glaciers melting. The images are accompanied by a poetic text that appear intermittently during the length of the video.
