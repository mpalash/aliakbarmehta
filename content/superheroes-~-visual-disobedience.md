**Where did you click the original photographs?**

I have been working on this series as an idea since March. I was part of an artist residency \[at SPACE 118, in Mazgaon], documenting the vanishing culture of Mazgaon and Wadi Bunder. My documentation was split into three parts – discovering the Site, Stage and Structure of Mazgoan and Wadi Bunder. So _Site_ was the absolute geographical location, the _Stage_ was pictures of the performances of the everyday and _Structure_ was the area’s architecture. The pictures that I have selected are from the _Stage_ part of my documentation.



**Where did the superhero concept arise from?**

I love the idea of superheroes as a contemporary myth. The pictures are of the working class, beggars and street urchins. I think of them as heroes because of their struggle for survival. It is a way of looking at their lives as heroic, a lionisation of these people. There is a certain amount of nobility in what they do. But there is a duality to this. They don’t really want to be lionised though or recognised as anything special. Conceptually, the work is also about fiction and reality and blurring the lines between the two.



**Lenticular has shown this blur between reality and fiction quite literally. How did you come across this medium?**

I think lenticular has been part of all of our childhoods. We had those taazos and then these round things we would get in Lays packets. Now lenticular prints of gods and goddesses have become famous. I never thought about it as amaterial for a particular work. But doing this work in video did not seem good enough. I wanted the viewer to see both, the original photograph and the costume. Also a photograph is more tangible, it’s almost a painting. All of this is fascinating.

Lenticular takes the work further. The superhero is one aspect of the composite and the secret identity of the real person is also important. This duality of the myth of superheroes becomes apparent because of lenticular. They are going about in the world doing what they do just like a superhero would. The costume might be fictionalisation, but the work is still asking whether these guys are invisible heroes or not. The trick as an artist is not stating which is which.



**Were you conscious of not coming across as just another photographer with a bleeding heart?**

I think I was very aware of that becoming a possibility in this series and I have very consciously stayed away from images that would seem condescending, or patronising or even cute. What I’ve ended up with is photographs of people who were involved in their own work. They weren’t pretending to do something else. They were being who they are, no pretence. Using lenticular as a technology, I was able to show the original subject as he or she is, but add my perspective on it too.



**How did you select the costumes for the superheroes?**

I wanted my intervention to be very minimal. I didn’t want to abandon the style of the golden age of superhero comics of the’50s and ’60s. There is a certain sense of drama, and the language is a little over-the-top and flowery. It has a certain identity. That’s the connect I wanted. The costumes in that sense are flashy at times. What became important for me to look at the image for what it is. There is one guy who is pulling a hand cart. The photograph itself comes across as a Herculean figure pulling a huge load. The photographs gave me clues. This guy needed super strength – so muscle not armour. Colour schemes came out of what they were wearing originally. That simplicity seems fantastic.



**What is the response to the show, and where do you go with this?**

A lot of the times, people who are observing the work walk past it expecting it to be yet another poor man’s photograph, but stop midway realising there is something special happening. That moment of magic is fabulous. Lenticular became, for me, the right blend of magic and simplicity in this work. In a way, this show ties up with what I have been doing since my first solo show at Tao. I had painted the face of the harlequin on faces of lesser privileged people for the series called Everybody is a Jester. For the India Art Festival, I have completed just seven pieces because of space constraints. But I hope this will be a much larger body of work.
