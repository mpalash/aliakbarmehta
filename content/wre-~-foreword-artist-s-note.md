  In 2002, my father, Yusuf Mehta, was commissioned to make a short documentary
  film on the Godhra riots in Gujarat, India, using amateur and found footage
  collected during the riots.


  >The 2002 Gujarat riots, also known as the 2002 Gujarat violence and the
  Gujarat pogrom, was a three-day period of inter-communal violence in the
  western Indian state of Gujarat. Following the initial incident there were
  further outbreaks of violence in Ahmedabad for three weeks; statewide, there
  were further outbreaks of mass killings against the minority Muslim population
  for three months. The burning of a train in Godhra on 27 February 2002, which
  caused the deaths of 58 Hindu pilgrims karsevaks returning from Ayodhya, is
  believed to have triggered the violence. Some commentators, however, hold the
  view that the attacks had been planned, were well orchestrated, and that the
  attack on the train was a “staged trigger” for what was actually premeditated
  violence.

According to official figures, the riots resulted in the deaths of 790 Muslims and 254 Hindus; 2,500 people were injured non-fatally, and 223 more were reported missing. Other sources estimate that up to 2,000 Muslims died. There were instances of rape, children being burned alive, and widespread looting and destruction of property. The Chief Minister at that time, Narendra Modi, currently the Prime Minister – has been accused of initiating and condoning the violence, as have police and government officials who allegedly directed the rioters and gave lists of Muslim-owned properties to them.

As an assistant to the project, I was to segregate and catalog 250 hours of footage, from which a 20 minute short film would be extracted. The first step was a marathon viewing of the footage. I was witnessing War and its aftermaths – kerosene fuelled fires, shattered, mutilated and gutted corpse-strewn landscapes; stories of ferocious combat, massacre, rape, pillage; and seemingly unending vengeance fuelled violence. This was one of the defining experiences of my life.

Six months later, when I saw the final edit of the film, it was a significantly milder experience, compared to the intensity of the original footage – I immediately missed most of the brutality, the carnage and the personal accounts of trauma I had viewed in the raw footage. I asked my father, “Why have most of the testimonies, the horror and the violence been edited out. Why are we not showing what really happened?” He replied, “The role of this film is to move people towards an understanding of the events, the facts and the nature of violence. At the same time, be mindful that this intent is not to create a bias either for or against. As a documentary filmmaker, one has to keep their personal ideology out of it. There is a fine line between a documentary film and a propaganda film. As a filmmaker, as an artist, one has to keep that in mind.” The idea that representations of violence must be tempered with the responsibilities towards both sides of the story as well as toward the viewer has been a hard lesson to maintain.

How does one be unflinchingly neutral in the face of unprecedented violence? How do we look at a photograph or a video of violence and conflict without identifying a victim or a perpetrator? How do we look at an image without either condemning or condoning, without judgment or a feeling of aligning ourselves to either side? Do our placement within our respective cultures affect our perspective and understanding of an image of violence? Is such a culture specific reading desirable or does it further cultural alienation? Do images of violence emphasise the tragedy of loss or do they inflame feelings of hatred and vengeance? Can we measure our understanding of conflict and violence through the lens of moral righteousness; based on the validity of the cause as we understand it?

**War \[wawr] • noun**

> _War is an organised and often prolonged conflict that is carried out by states or non-state actors. It is generally characterised by extreme violence, social disruption and economic destruction. War should be understood as an actual, intentional and widespread armed conflict between political communities, and therefore is defined as a form of political violence or intervention._

One of the distinguishing features of modern life is that it supplies countless opportunities for regarding (at a distance) horrors taking place throughout the World. Images of atrocities have become something of a commonplace. But are viewers inured – or incited – to violence by the depiction of cruelty? Is the viewer’s perception of reality eroded by the daily barrage of such images? What does it mean to care about the suffering of strangers in far off places?

Wars have existed in our history but we treat them as a thing of the past. They continue into our present but have become part of what is Normal. The ultra familiar, ultra celebrated image – of agony, of ruin – is an unavoidable feature of our camera mediated knowledge of War. We have compartmentalised them, sorted and neatly folded them into civilisations, time periods, regions and nationalities. We have apportioned and distributed the trauma of War into bite-sized digestible pieces. We change the channel. By accepting war as normal we have become passive participants. War tears, rends. War rips open, eviscerates. War scorches. War dismembers. War ruins. War is actually Hell. Our failure is one of imagination and empathy. We have failed to hold this reality in mind. It is only when we are confronted with War in its entirety as a singular whole, there is a possibility to be shaken out of our complacence and jolted out of our stupor.

> _"We – this 'we' is everyone who has never experienced anything like what they went through – don’t understand. We don’t get it. We truly can’t imagine what it was like. We can’t imagine how dreadful, how terrifying war is; and how normal it becomes. Can’t understand, can’t imagine. That’s what every soldier, and every journalist and aid worker and independent observer who has put in time under fire, and had the luck to elude the death that struck down others nearby, stubbornly feels. And they are right."_
> – Susan Sontag, Regarding the Pain of Others

In 1950, William Faulkner said, “I decline to accept the end of man”. We would fall unworthy of his vision, if we do not bring ourselves to be fully aware that the colossal tragedy he refused to recognize sixty-four years ago is now nothing more than a simple scientific possibility. Faced with this awesome reality that must have seemed a mere utopia through all of human time, we, the inventors of tales, who will believe anything, feel entitled to believe that it is not yet too late to engage in the creation of the opposite utopia. A new and sweeping utopia of life, where no one will be able to decide for others how they die, where love will prove true and happiness be possible, and where the races condemned to years of solitude will have, at last and forever, a second opportunity on earth.
