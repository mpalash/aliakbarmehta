**Museum of Impossible Forms** in collaboration with Publics has invited artist-curator **Vidisha Fadescha** to present her practice through an artist talk moderated by **Ali Akbar Mehta**, and a performance at the **Today is Our Tomorrow Festival**, held at Kaiku.

Vidisha Fadescha’s practice as an artist-curator has evolved to include public engagements as a form of political discourse. Through parties and by investigating *sites of nightlight*, Vidhisha creates spaces for healing, for discourse and for norm-critical future-forward thinking.

During her talk, Vidisha Fadescha will present their praxis of looking at ‘*party as a form, and clubs as sites for art and politics*’. 

> I think of “community care” as a way to support each other and move into the future. A collective is always more empowered than an individual alone. Music has the power to transcend borders and language. People unite for those moments, and if in those moments we consider the bodies that are involved in giving us that experience, that would change its context. Nightlife takes from Queer, Black and Brown bodies, and our community gatherings. It’s important that these bodies are offered space and shared capital within the industry. A Queer gathering isn’t just about shimmer, cross dressing, or voguing. This gathering is also about solidarity, community, comfort, non-judgment and consent.

The Talk will take place at Stidilä, Kaiku, as part of the Today is Our Tomorrow Festival.

As a continuation of their talk at Stidilä, outlining *Party as a Tool for Care*, Fadescha's alter **Redrum** will play a Techno set to construct a gathering as being about solidarity, community, comfort, non-judgment, and consent.

Redrum will play at Stidila from 2:00 to 4:00 am as the closing gig on the Saturday Night’s programme.
