**Backlight** is an international photo festival organized every three years by Photographic Centre Nykyaika in the city of Tampere, Finland. Backlight is one of the oldest international photography festivals in Northern Europe. Now in its 13th edition, the triennial stays true to its pioneering spirit in the theme for the 2023 festival: Cruel Radiance.

What kind of evidentiary power can we associate with images in a world where man-made crises and conflicts have long since exceeded human proportions? How does matter, our material and elementary surroundings, record evidence of violence? What kind of roles do such non-human visual actors have in bearing witness to our pernicious actions? 

\*

Cruel Radiance, the 2023 edition of the Backlight festival, examines the evidential aspects of matter through photography and the moving image. From the omnipresence of particle pollution to the lasting legacies of nuclear weapons, from sub-zero temperatures to the residues of the mining industry, the exhibition sheds light on a whole variety of material elements as visual actors with singular testimonial capacities. In so doing, the stage is set for diverse visual dimensions and temporalities of violence ranging from slow cumulative processes to more abrupt conflicts. True to its title, Cruel Radiance invites the viewer to engage with a material repository of our ways of being together. 

Backlight´23 Photo Festival has been curated by visual artists Harri Pälviranta and Marko Karo.  

As part of the festival program, Backligt presents an exhibition produced in collaboration with students of three tertiary institutions. New Rays is an exhibition created by a new generation of makers. Reflecting Backlight2023’s theme Cruel Radiance, the exhibition portrays the invisible forces that are changing future realities.

The exhibition is produced in collaboration with Willem de Kooning in Rotterdam, Tampere University of Applied Science Fine Art (TAMK) and Tampere University Photojournalism (TAU) as well as  Photographic Center Nykyaika’s Backlight Festival. The exhibition will be displayed in the unique milieu of the demolition art house Pinni47, which will be demolished after the exhibition.  

In addition to the exhibitions, there will be artist talks at the galleries and the art museum on June 17th, and a short film screening at Arthouse Cinema Niagara on June 18th.   

The exhibitions of the Backlight Photo Festival have been produced in collaboration with the Majaoja foundation and Tampere Art Museum. The exhibitions have also received support from Arts Promotion Centre Finland, the City of Tampere, Finnfoto and the Patricia Seppälä foundation.
