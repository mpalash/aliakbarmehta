  Agonistic Intelligence/s (or another AI/s) is a gathering of invited provocateurs, guest speakers, and participants that convenes as a Summer School for the Helsinki Biennial 2023. This research-led working group engages with a shortlisted selection of the HAM art collection as a key focal node and as an ‘archival site of inquiry’. 


  To help us unpack the multiple overlapping thematics of the Biennial NEW DIRECTIONS MAY EMERGE and the Summer School, guest speakers are invited to engage with the working group and conduct open-to-public lectures. 


  Please join us to welcome **Dalida María Benfield** and **Christopher Bratton**

> Where, how, and when does “Art” happen? Who makes “Art”? Further, what are the frameworks through which we might formulate answers to these questions? How do we know what we know about “Art”? What are the schools, and the archives, that inform us? To discuss these questions, we use the radical concept of “deschooling” proposed by Ivan Illich in his book Deschooling Society, which makes a powerful argument for forms of learning outside of compulsory schooling. We will share international case studies of arts research and education practices outside of formal schools, including the work of the Center for Arts, Design, and Social Research. These produce relationships and projects that highlight the limits of how “Art” is normatively understood. We will also discuss how this work produces archives (or not), and what, then, might these deschooled archival practices teach us about “Art” museums and other institutional archives.

**Dalida María Benfield** & **Christopher Bratton** are artists and researchers who divide their time between Helsinki and Boston. In 2017, they co-founded the Center for Arts, Design, and Social Research (CAD+SR), a polycentric laboratory for research and practice focused on emancipatory and decolonial pedagogies. In collaboration with partners in Brazil, Colombia, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Kenya, Mexico, South Africa, and the UK, and the Senior Researchers and Research Fellows of CAD+SR, they organize international and intercultural research fellowships, projects, residencies, workshops, exhibitions, and publications. Most recently, they co-organized Technologies of Critical Conscientization (Con/Crit/Tec) at the Casa do Povo, São Paulo, Brazil and were the Special Guest Editors of Urgent Pedagogies, Issue #5: Pluriversality, IASPIS, Stockholm. Their collective writing on CAD+SR appears in the books Art as Social Practice: Technologies for Change, Routledge (2022), Sensing Earth, Valiz (2023) and The Routledge Companion to Decolonizing Art, Crafts, and Visual Culture Education (2023). They are co-editors, with Lucrezia Cipitelli and Luigi Coppola, of Ex-Situ – Compatible with Life – Plants for a world waiting to germinate, Kunstverein Milano (2023).
