summary: "**Purgatory Edit** (working title) proposes to use the Emotive Epoc+,
  a head-mounted home MRI kit and a wireless EEG gear that allows a ‘reading’ of
  the viewer’s semiconscious mind-states, abstract emotions such as frustration,
  anxiety, excitement, meditation, etc. and translates it into as numerical
  values. These values are fed into VDMX, a VJ software, to generate an
  algorithm based real-time stitching of a ‘string’ of videos/images from the
  two databanks and uses this data as parameters to control the flow of video
  sequence."

**Purgatory Edit** explores methods in which cinematic experiences may be accessed using new and innovative input technologies. Where the use of 360° videos are helping audiences to take control of the ‘camera’, AR/VR and XR devices allow freedom from the confines of the physical ‘meatspace’, the project taps into the early 90’s gaming conventions of MUD and MOO devices that allow audience/participants to take control of the narrative, where choice (of the player) is an active ingredient in furthering the gameplay narrative.

The fact that the Emotiv Epoc+ as a device is difficult to control with any degree of precision, allows participants varying degrees of looseness and ability to ‘play’ with the process – as they struggle to obtain a degree of control, attempting to will their subconscious minds to create specific sequences, often attempting to soothe/agitate their minds has unexpected results.

The project also aims to explore innovative uses of alternative media, such as 3D scanning and mapping to enable (participant) position located playback; use of body and ambient (light and sound-based) sensors; and experimenting with AR/VR/XR technologies – to challenge the current ways of engaging with cinematic experiences.

One of the underlying goals of this project is to explore the idea of a generative trace of a cinemtatic experience. By generative we mean visual 

By providing individual ‘scenes’ in the form of pre-curated footage, and an innovative device that uses brainwaves to control the montage-based conceptual narrative – the installation uses the participant’s state of mind to sequence and juxtapose the series of videos in ongoing, ever-changing permutations, thereby creating a non-looping, unending, unique cinematic experience – every time it is accessed. The intensity of footage change, the intensity of violence depicted, type of violence, as well as speed, fluctuations, and glitch are all affected by the brainwaves of the user, who views the ‘Livestream’ feed through VR (Virtual Reality) headsets, while a projection plays out this cinematic performance to other viewers.

While frustration as a mood brings forward conflict-oriented video clips, a more relaxed and meditative state of mind would be reflected in showing more peaceful scenes. Squinting of the eyes causes burring, while clenching of the jaws temporarily pauses the sequence, and blinking causes a rupture from the War and Peace Binary by toggling advertisements, and Kanye West music videos – another form of violence altogether.
