We filed slowly, languidly into the hall

The auditorium was vast and silent

As we seated and were darkened, the voice continued:



A Garden of Leaflessness, who says its isn’t beautiful?

A picket fence in my own home and the house of my people

Mute spectators in the cosmic coliseum, we witness:



A Kafkan wilderness – Cold metal Grey and dry dust

Rain-washed black tar, speckled with charcoal grey

Grey rats grey birds grey dogs and other grey bipeds

No red – only something soft that may pass for mud

A few tufts of hair and slivers of chewed out bleached bones



Damp, dank and dark are the colors of this world

Lifeless and drab, there are greens and blues

Dreamless machine lives and washed out hues



Overlooking civilization / Murakami upside down…

Super-non-Flat / where we are

Prisoners of own worlds isolated manifest before your eyes,

In parallel world Timespace Continuum wormhole Black hole reality

As breaths compress / stars die / Atlas, turns the axis

Atrophy to nerve ending capacity – no time. No time

I’ll be there when you’re gone.



Narcotic anarchic / Supernova Fantastic / stretching like elastic

Surrounding us engulfing us choking us drowning us

Womb of pain /Anti Mother / the Phantom Zone

Vast oceans of sand and watery deserts / barren and unforgiving

Thunderous, deafening, tumultuous / Brownian motion funeral march

Movement / no movement – pregnant stasis



Will we be destroyed by our very own silences?

The inherent soliloquies of a six billion planktonian people

Can we know ourselves if we don’t know where we are?



Glass palaces can exist

If only in my mind

In worlds of daydreams and sleepless nights

In spells, prayers and enchantments

In quantum theory and microphysics

Mythology and science fiction

These worlds shift, ripple and shimmer

Drip, meander and distort

Flow along from dream to dream,

And I move on.
