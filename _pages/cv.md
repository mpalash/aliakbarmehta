# **ALI AKBAR MEHTA**

(b. 1983, Mumbai, India)

[Ali Akbar Mehta](http://www.aliakbarmehta.com) (b.1983, Mumbai) is a Transmedia artist, curator, and researcher. Through a research-based practice, he creates immersive cyber archives that map narratives of history, memory, and identity constructs through a multifocal lens of violence, conflict, and trauma. Such archival mappings – as drawings, paintings, new media works, net-based projects, poems, essays, and theoretical texts, as well as performances both of bodies and networks – are rooted in datafeminst and posthumanist critical theories of making visible hegemonic power relations and silenced historical materialism. His ongoing doctoral research, tentatively titled ‘Practicing Online Performativity: Constructing Politically Conscious Archives for the Future’, is interested in exploring the performative relations between online archives and its users through the mediated interventions of Second Order Cybernetics, to create knowledge systems that outline a vibrant new political public sphere.

His work as performances, installations, and talks have been exhibited in galleries and alternative spaces in Mumbai, New Delhi, Pune, Helsinki, Tampere, Pori, Venice, Nova Gorica, Vienna, and Jyväskylä. Several of his projects, such as [256 Million Colours of Violence](http://www.256millioncoloursofviolence.com/), [Outsiders at Work](https://outsidersatwork.wordpress.com/), [Ballad of the Lost Utopian Meadow](https://www.thelostutopianmeadow.com/), and [Central Park Archives](https://www.m-cult.org/index.php/productions/central-park-archives), exist as permanent ongoing online projects.

He is co-founder, and co-Artistic Director (2018-2020) of [Museum of Impossible Forms](https://museumofimpossibleforms.org/), an anti-racist queer feminist project and cultural center in Kontula, Helsinki, a board member of [Kiila ry](http://kiila.eu/), and is pursuing his Doctoral Research in the Contemporary Art Department at [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/), Helsinki. He holds a BFA in Drawing & Painting from [Sir J.J. School of Art,](http://www.sirjjschoolofart.in/) Mumbai (2005), and an MA in Visual Culture, Curating, and Contemporary Art from Aalto University, Helsinki, Finland (2018), where he completed a thesis text titled ‘Cyber Archive: Being and Doing Knowledge’. 

He lives and works in Helsinki and Mumbai.
