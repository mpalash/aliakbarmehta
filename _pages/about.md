summary: " Transmedia Artist | Curator | Researcher

  I create immersive cyber archives that map narratives of history, memory, and identity through a multifocal lens of violence, conflict, and trauma. Such archival mappings – as drawings, paintings, new media works, net-based projects, poems, essays, and theoretical texts, as well as performances both of bodies and networks – are rooted in datafeminist, posthumanist critical theories of making visible hegemonic power relations and silenced historical materialism. My ongoing doctoral research _‘Practicing Online Performativity: Constructing Politically Conscious Archives for the Future’_, is interested in exploring the performative relations between online archives and its users through mediated interventions of Second Order Cybernetics, to create speculative knowledge systems that outline new political public spheres."
