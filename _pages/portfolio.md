## WAR • ROOM • ECHO – Regarding the Pain of Other Cyborgs

Violence and the culture it consumes/perpetuates is a fundamental condition lodged in the core of human experience. It is simultaneously private, public, self-intimating and collective. To make visible this condition, I began research in 2014 to compile a timeline of ‘every war, battle, revolt, revolution, siege, sacking, rebellion, bombing & insurgency’, from 3000 BC to the present. This timeline is the founding database of my collaborative performance-installation and research project, ‘WAR • ROOM • ECHO: Regarding the Pain of Other Cyborgs’. The title of the project refers to Susan Sontag’s seminal book, ‘Regarding the Pain of Others’, where she questions the validity of decontextualized representation of war photography.

Through this comprehensive timeline forming a database of human conflict, the project proposes to narrate a history of war, conflict, and violence as the most continuous, omnipresent & ongoing history of humanity, ‘a civil war on a planetary scale’ and evidence that the collective history of human conflict is second only to history of language/music.

The timeline will be translated into an ongoing multimedia performance-reading of this list titled, ‘Narrating War,’ that tells a story of an intense voyage rooted in ‘that first war’ leading to the most recent conflict, laying open the reality of it not being the last one either. As a performance that is designed to last for hours and often days – conducted at sites of violence, and sites of knowledge production – it is imagined to be an act of mourning, of remembrance, and deterrence from continued violence and conflict. Only when we are confronted with war in its entirety as a whole, as a continuous, singular event encompassing 5018 years, is there a possibility to be jolted out of our stupor and shed our complacence.

‘WAR • ROOM • ECHO – Regarding the Pain of Other Cyborgs’, is composed of several components, some of which have the potential to develop into stand-alone projects

1. ‘The War that is Coming is Not the Last One’ – site-specific wall drawing
2. ‘Narrating War’ – performance-reading of the list of wars, 2015 – ongoing
3. ‘War List Codex’ – timeline published as editions of books, 2015 – ongoing
4. ‘War.bot’ – code based new-media installation, currently researching
5. ‘The War is Over if You Want It’ – archival footage video 
6. ‘Game of War’ – animated infographic video
7. ‘Apocalypse Now’ – interactive post-apocalyptic virtual landscape, VR experience

‘Narrating War’ is one of the componenets of the project – the act of reading simultaneously becomes an act of mourning, remembrance and a call for action, towards change. Until now, readings have been performed across exhibitions in Mumbai, Helsinki, Tampere, Nova Goricia, and Pori.

256 Million Colours of Violence

‘256 Million Colours of Violence’ is an interactive and participatory survey-based artistic project where participants become co-archivists by creating new visual vocabulary that challenges the political-religious-socio-economic quadrangle.  Through the project’s participation form (www.256millioncoloursofviolence.com) participants seek and share their subliminal associations of ‘Colour of Violence’ while simultaneously addressing complexities of gender, race, ethnicity, privilege, social class, minimum wage, and other pressing issues.

After having received over 250 entries since launching the website in 2016, I’ve realised that survey-based artistic project participants are invited to interact with a deeply personal subject, must improve its access in visuality and use. It must provide participants with an archive that helps clarify concepts that appear in the drop down selection of answers to the questions in the participation form. By continuing to work on the project through my Ph.D., I want to update & present the project with:

1. An archive of explanatory database
2. A non-linear format UI for a user-friendly experience
3. Exhibition of the project
4. Physical gatherings forming tangible communities
5. Printing of Publication as user manual 
6. Translation of the project into Finnish (and subsequently into other languages)

The project is a timely contribution to the discourses regarding: ‘how we may think of the range of violence embedded in our own lives?’. This project can benefit anyone dealing with notions of violence and its presence within the various aspects of society, such as activists, researchers, artists, cultural theorists, students of social sciences, and general readers.
